Building upon the material in Data Science 1, the course introduces advanced methods for data wrangling, data visualization, and deep neural networks, statistical modeling, and prediction. Topics include big data and database management, multiple deep learning subjects such as CNNs, RNNs, autoencoders, and generative models as well as basic Bayesian methods, nonlinear statistical models and unsupervised learning. The programming language will be python. Tentative Course Topics Feed Forward Neural Networks Regularization of Neural Network Optimization of Neural Networks Autoencoders Convolutional Neural Networks Recurrent Neural Networks Variational AutoEncoders Generative Adversarial Networks Smoothing and Additive Models Unsupervised Learning Bayesian Inference Models, LDA SQL AWS Course Objectives Upon successful completion of this course, you should feel comfortable with the material mentioned above, plus you will have had experience in working with others on real-world problems. Both the content knowledge, the project, and teamwork, will prepare you for the professional world or further studies. Course Components There will be live video feed available only to distance education students for lectures, labs, and advanced sections. Recordings for all other students will be available within 24 hrs. Lectures The class meets twice a week for lectures. Attending lectures is a crucial component of learning the material presented in this course. Labs Lectures are supplemented by weekly programming labs. Labs are an important aspect of the course, as they supplement material from lectures with examples, discuss programming environments, and teach you important skills. In-class Quizzes At the end of each lecture, we will ask you to take a short graded quiz on the material presented in class. These quizzes will count towards your final grade. Advanced Sections The course will include advanced sections for 209 students and will cover a different topic per week. These are 75 min lectures and they will cover advanced topics like the mathematical underpinnings of the methods seen in lecture and lab and extensions of those methods. The material covered in the advanced sections is required for all ac209 students. Tentative topics are: Earth Mover's Distance Dropout ConvNets: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-15, ResNet and Inception LSTN, GRU in NLP Neural style transfer learning Deep Reinforcement Learning Variational Inference Exams There are no exams in this course. Projects - For distant students The goal of the project is to have a complete end-to-end data science process encompassing both semesters of subject material while working as a 3-4 person team. We will supply a small set of project choices within the thematic categories. Teams may propose a different project with sufficient notice and will be subject to approval by the course staff. - For campus students During the final four (4) weeks of the course, students will be divided in break-out thematic sections where they will study topics such as medicine, law, astronomy, e-commerce, and government. Each section will include lectures by Harvard faculty, experts on the field, followed by project work also led by that faculty. You will get to present your projects in the SEAS Design Fair at the end of the semester. Homework Assignments There will be seven graded homework assignments. Some of them will be due one week after being assigned and some will be due two weeks after being assigned. For five assignments, you have the option to work and submit in pairs, the two remaining are to be completed individually. Course Resources Online Materials All course materials, including lecture notes, lab notes, and section notes will be published in the class GitHub: https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2019-CS109B . Assignments will only be posted on Canvas. Working environment You will be working in Jupyter Notebooks which you can run in your own machine or in the SEAS JupyterHub cloud (details on this to come). Recommended Textbooks ISLR: An Introduction to Statistical Learning. by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (Springer: New York, 2013) DL: Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. Free electronic versions are available ( ISLR ), ( DL) or hard copy through Amazon ( ISLR) , ( DL ). Getting Help For questions about homework, course content, package installation, the process is: try to troubleshoot yourself by reading the lecture, lab, and section notes, and looking up online resources. go to office hours this is the best way to get help. post on the class Piazza; we want you and your peers to engage in helping each other. TFs also monitor Piazza and will respond within 24 hours. Note that Piazza questions are visible to everyone. If you are citing homework solution code you want to post privately so that only the staff sees your message. watch for official announcements via Canvas so make sure you have your Canvas notifications turned on. Piazza should always be your first resource for seeking answers to your content questions. send an email to the Helpline ( cs109b2019@gmail.com ) for administrative issues, regrade requests, and non-content specific questions we have this email account. for personal matters that you do not feel comfortable sharing with the TFs, you may send an email to either or both of the instructors. Course Policies and Expectations Grading for CS109b, STAT121b, and CS209b: <<<<<<< HEAD ======= 3aa6558f04b882eacb6af4d0b69db82445ca5329 Paired-option Homeworks 45% (5 homework for which you have the option to work in pairs) Individual Homeworks 25% (2 homework which you must complete individually) Quizzes 10% (you may drop 40% of the quizzes) Project 20% TOTAL 100% Note: Regular homework (for everyone) counts as 5 points. 209b extra homework counts as 1 point. Grading for DCE: Paired-option Homeworks 48% (5 homework for which you have the option to work in pairs) Individual Homeworks 28% (2 homework which you must complete individually) Project 24% TOTAL 100% Collaboration Policy We expect you to adhere to the Harvard Honor Code at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board. If you work with a partner on an assignment make sure both parties solve all the problems. Do not divide and conquer. You are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. In particular: if you work with a fellow student but decide to submit different papers, include the name of each other in the designated area of the submission paper. if you work with a fellow student and want to submit the same paper you need to form a group prior to the submission. Details in the assignment. Not all assignments will permit group submissions. you need to write your solutions entirely on your own or with your collaborator you are welcome to take ideas from code presented in labs, lecture, or sections but you need to change it, adapt it to your style, and ultimately write your own. We do not want to see code copied verbatim from the above sources. if you use code found on the internet, books, or other sources you need to cite those sources. you should not view any written materials or code created by other students for the same assignment; you may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future. if the assignment allows it you may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. Late or Wrongly Submitted Assignments There are no late days in homework submission. We will accept late submissions only for medical reasons and if accompanied by a doctor's note. To submit after Canvas has closed or to ask for an extension , send an email to the Helpline with subject line \"Submit HW1: Reason=the flu\" replacing 'HW1' with the name of the current assignment and \"the flu\" with your reason. You need to attach the note from your medical provider otherwise we will not accept the request. If you forgot to join a Group with your peer and are asking for the same grade we will accept this with no penalty up to HW3. For homeworks beyond that we feel that you should be familiar with the process of joining groups. After that there will be a penalty of -1 point for both members of the group provided the submission was on time. Re-grade Requests Our graders and instructors make every effort in grading accurately and in giving you a lot of feedback. If you discover that your answer to a homework problem was correct but it was marked as incorrect, send an email to the Helpline with a description of the error. Please do not submit regrade requests based on what you perceive is overly harsh grading . The points we take off are based on a grading rubric that is being applied uniformly to all assignments. If you decide to send a regrade request , send an email to the Helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Grader=johnsmith\" replacing 'HW1' with the current assignment and 'johnsmith' with the name of the grader within 48 hours of the grade release . Auditing the Class If you would like to audit the class, please send an email to the Helpline indicating who you are and why you want to audit the class. You need a HUID to be included to Canvas. Academic Integrity Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. For more detailed expectations, please refer to the Collaborations section above. Accommodations for students with disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term, (fill in specific date). Failure to do so may result in the Course Head's inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although Faculty are invited to contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation. Diversity and Inclusion Statement Data Science, like many fields of science, has historically only been represented by a small sliver of the population. This is despite some of the early computer scientist pioneers being women (see Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper for two examples). Recent initiatives have attempted to overcome some barriers to entry: Made w/ Code . We would like to attempt to discuss diversity in data science from time to time where appropriate and possible. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the diversity of the course materials. Furthermore, we would like to create a learning environment for our students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Harvard records, please let us know! If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion . We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.) As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"Lecture 19: GANS","text":"Slides Lecture 20 PDF Lecture 20 PPTX","tags":"pages","url":"pages/lecture20/"},{"title":"Lab 10: Variational Autoencoders","text":"Lab 10 Notebooks Notebook","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab10/"},{"title":"Lab 10: Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders","text":"/*! * * IPython notebook * */ /* CSS font colors for translated ANSI colors. */ .ansibold { font-weight: bold; } /* use dark versions for foreground, to improve visibility */ .ansiblack { color: black; } .ansired { color: darkred; } .ansigreen { color: darkgreen; } .ansiyellow { color: #c4a000; } .ansiblue { color: darkblue; } .ansipurple { color: darkviolet; } .ansicyan { color: steelblue; } .ansigray { color: gray; } /* and light for background, for the same reason */ .ansibgblack { background-color: black; } .ansibgred { background-color: red; } .ansibggreen { background-color: green; } .ansibgyellow { background-color: yellow; } .ansibgblue { background-color: blue; } .ansibgpurple { background-color: magenta; } .ansibgcyan { background-color: cyan; } .ansibggray { background-color: gray; } div.cell { /* Old browsers */ display: -webkit-box; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-align: stretch; display: -moz-box; -moz-box-orient: vertical; -moz-box-align: stretch; display: box; box-orient: vertical; box-align: stretch; /* Modern browsers */ display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: stretch; border-radius: 2px; box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: transparent; width: 100%; padding: 5px; /* This acts as a spacer between cells, that is outside the border */ margin: 0px; outline: none; border-left-width: 1px; padding-left: 5px; background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent -40px, transparent 1px, transparent 1px, transparent 100%); } div.cell.jupyter-soft-selected { border-left-color: #90CAF9; border-left-color: #E3F2FD; border-left-width: 1px; padding-left: 5px; border-right-color: #E3F2FD; border-right-width: 1px; background: #E3F2FD; } @media print { div.cell.jupyter-soft-selected { border-color: transparent; } } div.cell.selected { border-color: #ababab; border-left-width: 0px; padding-left: 6px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #42A5F5 -40px, #42A5F5 5px, transparent 5px, transparent 100%); } @media print { div.cell.selected { border-color: transparent; } } div.cell.selected.jupyter-soft-selected { border-left-width: 0; padding-left: 6px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #42A5F5 -40px, #42A5F5 7px, #E3F2FD 7px, #E3F2FD 100%); } .edit_mode div.cell.selected { border-color: #66BB6A; border-left-width: 0px; padding-left: 6px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #66BB6A -40px, #66BB6A 5px, transparent 5px, transparent 100%); } @media print { .edit_mode div.cell.selected { border-color: transparent; } } .prompt { /* This needs to be wide enough for 3 digit prompt numbers: In[100]: */ min-width: 14ex; /* This padding is tuned to match the padding on the CodeMirror editor. */ padding: 0.4em; margin: 0px; font-family: monospace; text-align: right; /* This has to match that of the the CodeMirror class line-height below */ line-height: 1.21429em; /* Don't highlight prompt number selection */ -webkit-touch-callout: none; -webkit-user-select: none; -khtml-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none; /* Use default cursor */ cursor: default; } @media (max-width: 540px) { .prompt { text-align: left; } } div.inner_cell { min-width: 0; /* Old browsers */ display: -webkit-box; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-align: stretch; display: -moz-box; -moz-box-orient: vertical; -moz-box-align: stretch; display: box; box-orient: vertical; box-align: stretch; /* Modern browsers */ display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: stretch; /* Old browsers */ -webkit-box-flex: 1; -moz-box-flex: 1; box-flex: 1; /* Modern browsers */ flex: 1; } /* input_area and input_prompt must match in top border and margin for alignment */ div.input_area { border: 1px solid #cfcfcf; border-radius: 2px; background: #f7f7f7; line-height: 1.21429em; } /* This is needed so that empty prompt areas can collapse to zero height when there is no content in the output_subarea and the prompt.

What do you observe? In [ ]: #try it here Example 4: Reinforcement Learning with Open AI Gym In this lab we are going to work with OpenAIgym's FrozenLake environment. The details of the environment can be found in the link https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/ . Winter is here. You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the park when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake. The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted. If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water. At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so it's absolutely imperative that you navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc. The agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile. The surface is described using a grid like the following: [PP: WOULD IT BETTER TO INCLUDE A DIAGRAM] S: starting point, safe F: frozen surface, safe H: hole, fall to your doom G: goal, where the frisbee is located SFFF FHFH FFFH HFFG Expected actions are Left(0), Right(1), Down(2), Up(3). The episode ends when you reach the goal or fall in a hole. You receive a reward of 1 if you reach the goal, and zero otherwise.

At the end of the year, students from each school's program took the SATs and we've recorded the students' average performance relative to a control group that got no treatment. We've also recorded the standard error for each school's estimated increase, a measure of how accurate the estimated increase is. (Standard Error factors in the number of students who took the program and how variable their scores were). In [3]: school_data = pd . read_csv ( \"data/gelman_schools.csv\" ) school_data Out[3]: .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } School Estimated Score Increase Standard error of the estimate 0 A 28 15 1 B 8 10 2 C -3 16 3 D 7 11 4 E -1 9 5 F 1 11 6 G 18 10 7 H 12 18 The measurements look something like this: In [4]: x_vals = np . linspace ( - 50 , 80 , 1000 ) for cur_school_id in range ( 8 ): name = school_data [ \"School\" ][ cur_school_id ] mean = school_data [ \"Estimated Score Increase\" ][ cur_school_id ] sd = school_data [ \"Standard error of the estimate\" ][ cur_school_id ] norm_obj = scipy . stats . norm ( mean , sd ) plt . plot ( x_vals , norm_obj . pdf ( x_vals ), label = name ) plt . xlabel ( \"School's Performance\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Probability Density\" ) plt . legend () plt . show () Discussion How effective is the program? Does it increase scores? By how much? A Hierarchical Model for the Schools Gelman (or maybe Rubin?) proposed the following model to explain the data and understand the effect of the program on SAT scores. As in class, the point of the model is that it neither takes each school's result at face value, nor ignores variation from school to school. $$\\sigma_j\\ given$$ $$\\mu \\sim Uniform(-20,20)$$ $$\\tau \\sim Uniform(0,10)$$ $$\\theta_j \\sim Normal(Mean=\\mu,\\ SD=\\tau)$$ $$y_j \\sim Normal(Mean=\\theta_j,\\ SD=\\sigma_j)$$ $y_j$ are the observed SAT increase at each school $\\sigma_j$ are the observed standard errors at each school $\\theta_j$ is the 'true' effect of each school's program $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ govern the distribution of possible true effects. Bayesian models (and others) are often presented like this. Actually, they're usually presented even less clearly (e.g. missing the definition of each symbol). Let's learn how to make sense of this jumble. First pass: Understanding the parameters This pass is typically easiest from bottom to top, starting with the observed parameters that you know how to interpret. It often also requires reading about the context of the data or what the modeler is trying to encode with each parameter. $$y_j \\sim Normal(Mean=\\theta_j,\\ SD=\\sigma_j)$$ First, the observed data (one value per school) are 1) normally distributed 2) each centered at a different value, one per school. The 8 $\\theta_j$ parameters are the 'true average effect' of the program in school j, separate from the (noisy) effect we actually observe. $$\\theta_j \\sim Normal(Mean=\\mu,\\ SD=\\tau)$$ Where do the 'true average effects' in each school come from? Line 2, above, says that they're all draws from a normal distribution with a particular mean and center. Okay, so they're all form the same family, that's fine for now. Moving on, $$\\sigma_j\\ given$$ $$\\mu \\sim Uniform(-20,20)$$ $$\\tau \\sim Uniform(0,10)$$ Finally, the parameters defining what 'true average effects' we might see come from specific uniform distributions. In particular, the author encodes that the center of the 'true average effect' distribution is strictly between -20 and 20, and the spread of the 'true average effect' distribution is somewhere betweeen 0 and 10. Seconnd Pass: Summarizing : The author's story is that when someone goes to implement this cirriculum in a given school, the actual (long term?) effectiveness of that program is secretly picked from a normal distribution. Then the actual observed effect is a noisy version of that actual effectiveness, with the noise set by that school's standard error. (The school's standard error is set by the number of students who were in the program and the variability in how well those students did, but this model takes that as given for each school). Third pass: Critiquing the story Discussion Does the author's overall story make sense? Do you believe in a 'true' effectiveness in each school, distinct from the observed effectiveness? Do you believe that schools' 'true' effectiveness all come from some distribution? Or do you think they're all the same? Or all unrelated? What does it mean, in context, for the author to say $\\mu$ is definitely between -20 and 20? Does that seem reasonable to you? What does it mean, in context, for the author to say $\\tau$ is definitely between 0 and 10? Does that seem reasonable to you? As a class, come up with a prior for $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ Coding the Model To work in JAGS, we need to write out the model in a specific code-like format. That format is designed to be a mix of the equation description of the model above and R syntax. The tricky parts are: Writing a loop for any varibles with indices, and double loops if the variable has two indices Looking up the abreviation for each ditribution (usualy the letter d and a short-ish version of the distribution name) Looking up the parameters the distributions want (does it ask for mean, sd, or precision?) Looking up how to do functions like $x&#94;2$ in R Compare: There are J schools $$\\sigma_j\\ given$$ $$\\mu \\sim Uniform(-20,20)$$ $$\\tau \\sim Uniform(0,10)$$ $$\\theta_j \\sim Normal(Mean=\\mu,\\ SD=\\tau)$$ $$y_j \\sim Normal(Mean=\\theta_j,\\ SD=\\sigma_j)$$ To: In [5]: schools_model_code = ''' model { mu ~ dunif(-20,20) tau ~ dunif(0,10) for (j in 1:J){ theta[j] ~ dnorm(mu, 1/pow(tau,2)) } for (j in 1:J){ y[j] ~ dnorm(theta[j], 1/pow(sigma[j],2)) } } ''' Running the model To run the model, you need to pass in a dictionary of the observed data. Pyjags is pretty good about giving useful error messages, but definitely turn on line numbers in Jupyter! We run 500 samples of burn-in (MCMC needs some undefined amount of steps before it produces samples from the target distribution). We then collect 2500 actual samples from each of 4 chains. In [6]: observed_vals = { 'y' : school_data [ \"Estimated Score Increase\" ], 'sigma' : school_data [ \"Standard error of the estimate\" ], 'J' : school_data . shape [ 0 ]} num_chains = 4 school_model = pyjags . Model ( schools_model_code , data = observed_vals , chains = num_chains ) burnin = school_model . sample ( 500 ) #warmup/burn-in samples = school_model . sample ( 2500 ) #cf 7500 adapting: iterations 4000 of 4000, elapsed 0:00:00, remaining 0:00:00 sampling: iterations 2000 of 2000, elapsed 0:00:00, remaining 0:00:00 sampling: iterations 10000 of 10000, elapsed 0:00:00, remaining 0:00:00 Checking Convergence MCMC is only guaranteed to work if you run it for infinite time. It can give good samples after finite, or even short time, but it's worth checking whether it looks like it did return good samples. The first thing to check is whether the sampler got stuck in one place for a bit by looking for flat/thin regions in the trace. Luckily, we have a lot to show you In [7]: def plot_trace ( samples , varname , entry = 0 ): plt . plot () sample_array = samples [ varname ] vec_len , num_samples , num_chains = sample_array . shape for cur_chain in range ( num_chains ): cur_label = \"Chain {} \" . format ( cur_chain ) plt . plot ( range ( num_samples ), sample_array [ entry ,:, cur_chain ], label = cur_label ) plt . legend () plt . show () We check the $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ parameters In [8]: plt . xlabel ( \"Iteration\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Value of Mu\" ) plot_trace ( samples , 'mu' ) plt . xlabel ( \"Iteration\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Value of Tau\" ) plot_trace ( samples , 'tau' ) and the 8 different $\\theta_j$ In [9]: for cur_school in range ( 8 ): print ( \"Theta for School {} \" . format ( cur_school )) plt . xlabel ( \"Iteration\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Value of Theta_ {} \" . format ( cur_school )) plot_trace ( samples , 'theta' , entry = cur_school ) print ( \"------\" ) Theta for School 0 ------ Theta for School 1 ------ Theta for School 2 ------ Theta for School 3 ------ Theta for School 4 ------ Theta for School 5 ------ Theta for School 6 ------ Theta for School 7 ------ Overall, we see pretty rough traces- lots of places with limited variation. Fixing these defects is tough . Simply running more samples gives you better odds that you've got stuck for an even amount of time in each trap, though it's more 'hope' than 'strategy'. Changing the priors or even how the model is written can help ease the issues. More advanced samplers (e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo implemented in pymc3 or Stan) can help, too. There are other measures of whether the traces look reasonable- effective sample size, R-hat, and Geweke. In real life, you should carefully vet your traces and adjust the model/sampler until they look good . See AM207 for lots more on this topic. Here, we're just going to press on as if the traces and samples are legitimate Exploring The Posterior The samples produced are basically a big data frame where each row is a sample and each column is one of the prameters of the model. This is everything we know about the posterior. Conceptually, from here forward all we do is describe this data frame- means or histograms or the columns, correlations, etc. (The samples aren't actually stored as a data frame, but conversion code is provided below) In [10]: samples Out[10]: {'J': array([[[8., 8., 8., 8.], [8., 8., 8., 8.], [8., 8., 8., 8.], ..., [8., 8., 8., 8.], [8., 8., 8., 8.], [8., 8., 8., 8.]]]), 'mu': array([[[11.44200703, -5.2483797 , 3.67912647, 0.0738187 ], [12.26069247, -5.48494222, 3.61115491, 4.95019625], [10.73895563, -5.085733 , 3.18646544, 4.80098972], ..., [11.17434202, 8.62852242, 8.57332894, 3.38636574], [11.32547262, 3.60811946, 7.74219932, 6.88329731], [11.64152507, 3.81368591, 9.61093627, 7.36313944]]]), 'sigma': array([[[15., 15., 15., 15.], [15., 15., 15., 15.], [15., 15., 15., 15.], ..., [15., 15., 15., 15.], [15., 15., 15., 15.], [15., 15., 15., 15.]], [[10., 10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10., 10.], ..., [10., 10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10., 10.]], [[16., 16., 16., 16.], [16., 16., 16., 16.], [16., 16., 16., 16.], ..., [16., 16., 16., 16.], [16., 16., 16., 16.], [16., 16., 16., 16.]], ..., [[11., 11., 11., 11.], [11., 11., 11., 11.], [11., 11., 11., 11.], ..., [11., 11., 11., 11.], [11., 11., 11., 11.], [11., 11., 11., 11.]], [[10., 10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10., 10.], ..., [10., 10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10., 10.]], [[18., 18., 18., 18.], [18., 18., 18., 18.], [18., 18., 18., 18.], ..., [18., 18., 18., 18.], [18., 18., 18., 18.], [18., 18., 18., 18.]]]), 'tau': array([[[5.22944064, 0.51424254, 0.57377092, 7.70896573], [4.12126626, 0.62418476, 0.55211472, 5.65434903], [5.02714961, 1.34672645, 0.55877668, 7.79227361], ..., [1.74828205, 5.63677814, 8.53923862, 7.55739259], [1.74222428, 5.65749486, 8.58125167, 8.09525945], [2.69541102, 4.94712847, 7.39562856, 7.32618989]]]), 'theta': array([[[16.61972838, -5.56344442, 3.49366297, 13.04717757], [ 7.77682071, -5.49960964, 3.53405496, 6.83151556], [16.46103894, -5.75185783, 2.86776548, 3.62641676], ..., [16.8258211 , 10.39344698, -1.57631373, 18.03982207], [ 8.72831671, 8.30629003, 13.73868418, 17.59792133], [12.05765791, -2.24196389, 27.22559778, 25.53386541]], [[19.56954737, -5.42537957, 4.05026727, 1.03910367], [11.59722917, -5.74709919, 4.54484246, 5.87960291], [ 6.367036 , -6.01464545, 3.39471538, 4.42970772], ..., [ 8.57546221, 10.32027721, 12.7106045 , 1.31254366], [ 8.38944263, 6.24801873, 7.44531707, 5.27553666], [10.90258801, 3.43412943, 10.33769674, 9.0311747 ]], [[ 5.88837309, -4.81366293, 3.15127896, -6.05951826], [14.78128587, -5.73556426, 3.71896808, 2.57675358], [12.54597606, -5.0653308 , 3.18413593, 0.49493214], ..., [11.98891272, 14.48338533, 13.87393438, 0.28335609], [10.9354531 , 8.07284582, -3.44999072, 9.18619352], [11.64331293, 10.64072935, 0.95014784, -0.21079075]], ..., [[ 1.22263673, -4.68733117, 3.31083688, 0.25609424], [18.55268161, -6.09756273, 4.05988122, 12.64476468], [ 6.71437458, -4.61057384, 3.52748741, -9.89316271], ..., [12.20384369, 4.68861594, 6.5070424 , 3.57409133], [ 8.62450786, 8.8124001 , 4.52069646, 0.46528057], [10.86269654, 6.22219415, 4.76471052, 6.61856667]], [[14.92735666, -5.68611841, 3.78224308, 9.02318814], [14.07864705, -4.10942606, 3.2962622 , 14.81264762], [16.15917815, -5.94679351, 3.74045733, 5.33112382], ..., [13.46168853, 8.76175389, 8.48475549, 3.892842 ], [ 9.52856636, 7.49486197, 15.59616436, 2.57200075], [12.38932389, 10.33383833, 1.72877462, 7.3614203 ]], [[10.48061998, -5.45665423, 3.91330464, 0.06519383], [16.33537128, -5.73639233, 4.15078261, 13.75552883], [10.26217066, -6.05283819, 3.24939955, 11.2550645 ], ..., [ 8.85214681, 4.31514814, 5.14246541, 8.71776731], [13.72143201, 9.21182701, 10.58598474, -1.14178797], [12.69258184, 6.78170005, 14.78258857, -1.19588779]]]), 'y': array([[[28., 28., 28., 28.], [28., 28., 28., 28.], [28., 28., 28., 28.], ..., [28., 28., 28., 28.], [28., 28., 28., 28.], [28., 28., 28., 28.]], [[ 8., 8., 8., 8.], [ 8., 8., 8., 8.], [ 8., 8., 8., 8.], ..., [ 8., 8., 8., 8.], [ 8., 8., 8., 8.], [ 8., 8., 8., 8.]], [[-3., -3., -3., -3.], [-3., -3., -3., -3.], [-3., -3., -3., -3.], ..., [-3., -3., -3., -3.], [-3., -3., -3., -3.], [-3., -3., -3., -3.]], ..., [[ 1., 1., 1., 1.], [ 1., 1., 1., 1.], [ 1., 1., 1., 1.], ..., [ 1., 1., 1., 1.], [ 1., 1., 1., 1.], [ 1., 1., 1., 1.]], [[18., 18., 18., 18.], [18., 18., 18., 18.], [18., 18., 18., 18.], ..., [18., 18., 18., 18.], [18., 18., 18., 18.], [18., 18., 18., 18.]], [[12., 12., 12., 12.], [12., 12., 12., 12.], [12., 12., 12., 12.], ..., [12., 12., 12., 12.], [12., 12., 12., 12.], [12., 12., 12., 12.]]])} In [11]: display ( samples [ 'theta' ] . shape ) display ( samples [ 'mu' ] . shape ) (8, 2500, 4) (1, 2500, 4) The raw samples from pyjags are a dictionary of parameeter names -> 3d arrays Discussion Why are the sample object's arrays shaped like this?

Posterior Probability\" ) plt . legend () plt . show () Above, we see that (assuming this model+priors and factoring in all data) $\\mu$ seems to range from about -2.5 to about 20, and its most likely value is between 5 and 10. Example : What's the probability that $\\mu$ is above 5? What does this mean in context? Answer : In [14]: count_above_5 = np . sum ( chain_df_list [ 0 ][ 'mu' ] > 15 ) total = len ( chain_df_list [ 0 ][ 'mu' ]) count_above_5 / total Out[14]: 0.0468 (Using just chain 0), there's a roughly 2-8% chance (changes from run to run) that $\\mu$ is above 15. In context, this means that a there's very little chance the program, on average, increases student scores by 15 or more. Practically, we might decide that the program isn't worth it; maybe we only feel increases of less than 50 SAT points aren't worth paying for. Discussion Is it more apropriate to use one chain, or combine all four? Repeating that plot for $\\tau$ In [15]: for cur_chain in range ( num_chains ): plt . hist ( chain_df_list [ cur_chain ][ 'tau' ], bins = 100 , histtype = 'step' , density = True , label = \"Chain {} \" . format ( cur_chain )); plt . xlabel ( \"Value of tau\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Approx. Posterior Probability\" ) plt . legend () plt . show () Exercise 1 What can you conclude from the plot above? Answer : Exploring effect in each school Investigating the $\\theta_j$ is a touch more complex becuase there is one per school. Overall, it looks like each school's theta is about the same-- the model is suggesting pooling all the schools' data together. We can also see some issues from the sampler manifesting; different chains get stuck in and create bumps in different places.

What's the probability that the program, on average, actually lowers scores? What's the probability that a particular school would end up with a program that lowers student scores? Can you make the MCMC converge better? Better priors? Longer sampling run? Answers : Discussion Overall, what does a Bayesian analysis buy you? What is the price of entry? Harry Potter and the Latent Dirichlet Analysis Before we do anything else, let's talk about the Dirichlet distribution The Dirichlet distribution takes in N parameters and spits out a probability vector of length N. The above graphs show which probability vectors are likely for different parameter settings, but it's easiest just to see for yourself: In [50]: length = 3 for rep in range ( 5 ): vec = np . random . dirichlet ([ . 1 ] * length ) print ( np . round ( vec , 3 )) [0.036 0.034 0.931] [0. 0.034 0.966] [0. 1. 0.] [0.344 0.656 0. ] [0. 1. 0.] (above) Values less than 1 make a few entries of the output vector large, and most entries small In [51]: for rep in range ( 5 ): vec = np . random . dirichlet ([ 1 ] * length ) print ( np . round ( vec , 3 )) [0.559 0.329 0.112] [0.263 0.038 0.699] [0.716 0.133 0.151] [0.408 0.086 0.506] [0.657 0.272 0.071] (above) Values of 1 make all possible probability vectors equally likely, in some sense Exercise 3 What happens when the inputs to Dirichlet are all large (above 1)? What happens if you make one entry substantially bigger than the others? Answer : The LDA Model (as code) Prof Glickman did a good job in lecture covering LDA from lots of different viewpoints. The one thing we haven't seen is actual code to produce a document via the LDA framework. I honestly think this is the clearest way to tell LDA's story.

By the end of this lab, you should: know how to put together the building blocks used in RNNs and its variants (GRU, LSTM) in keras with an example. have a good undertanding on how sequences - any dataset that has some temporal semantics (time series, natural language, images etc.) fit into and benefit from a recurrent architecture be familiar with preprocessing text, dynamic embeddings be familiar with gradient issues on RNNs processing longer sentence lengths understand different kinds of LSTM architectures - classifier, sequence to sequence models and their far-reaching applications 1. IMDB Review Classification Battlefield - Contestants : Feedforward, CNN, RNN, LSTM In this task, we are going to do sentiment classification on a movie review dataset. We are going to build a feedforward net, a convolutional neural net, a recurrent net and combine one or more of them to understand performance of each of them. A sentence can be thought of as a sequence of words which have semantic connections across time. By semantic connection, we mean that the words that occur earlier in the sentence influence the sentence's structure and meaning in the latter part of the sentence. There are also semantic connections backwards in a sentence, in an ideal case (in which we use RNNs from both directions and combine their outputs). But for the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to restrict ourselves to only uni-directional RNNs. In [2]: import numpy from keras.datasets import imdb from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense from keras.layers import LSTM , SimpleRNN from keras.layers.embeddings import Embedding from keras.layers import Flatten from keras.preprocessing import sequence from keras.layers.convolutional import Conv1D from keras.layers.convolutional import MaxPooling1D from keras.layers.embeddings import Embedding import numpy as np # fix random seed for reproducibility numpy . random . seed ( 1 ) Using TensorFlow backend. In [3]: # We want to have a finite vocabulary to make sure that our word matrices are not arbitrarily small vocabulary_size = 10000 #We also want to have a finite length of reviews and not have to process really long sentences. max_review_length = 500 TOKENIZATION For practical data science applications, we need to convert text into tokens since the machine understands only numbers and not really English words like humans can. As a simple example of tokenization, we can see a small example. Assume we have 5 sentences. This is how we tokenize them into numbers once we create a dictionary. i have books - [1, 4, 7] interesting books are useful [10,2,9,8] i have computers [1,4,6] computers are interesting and useful [6,9,11,10,8] books and computers are both valuable. [2,10,2,9,13,12] Bye Bye [7,7] Create tokens for vocabulary based on frequency of occurrence. Hence, we assign the following tokens I-1, books-2, computers-3, have-4, are-5, computers-6,bye-7, useful-8, are-9, and-10,interesting-11, valuable-12, both-13 Thankfully, in our dataset it is internally handled and each sentence is represented in such tokenized form. Load data In [ ]: ( X_train , y_train ), ( X_test , y_test ) = imdb . load_data ( num_words = vocabulary_size ) print ( 'Number of reviews' , len ( X_train )) print ( 'Length of first and fifth review before padding' , len ( X_train [ 0 ]) , len ( X_train [ 4 ])) print ( 'First review' , X_train [ 0 ]) print ( 'First label' , y_train [ 0 ]) Preprocess data Pad sequences in order to ensure that all inputs have same sentence length and dimensions. In [ ]: X_train = sequence . pad_sequences ( X_train , maxlen = max_review_length ) X_test = sequence . pad_sequences ( X_test , maxlen = max_review_length ) print ( 'Length of first and fifth review after padding' , len ( X_train [ 0 ]) , len ( X_train [ 4 ])) MODEL 1(a) : FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS WITHOUT EMBEDDINGS Let us build a single layer feedforward net with 250 nodes. Each input would be a 500-dim vector of tokens since we padded all our sequences to size 500. EXERCISE : Calculate the number of parameters involved in this network and implement a feedforward net to do classification without looking at cells below. In [ ]: #### YOUR CODE HERE #### Discussion : Why was the performance bad ? What was wrong with tokenization ? MODEL 1(b) : FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS WITH EMBEDDINGS What is an embedding layer ? An embedding is a linear projection from one vector space to another. We usually use embeddings to project the one-hot encodings of words on to a lower-dimensional continuous space so that the input surface is dense and possibly smooth. According to the model, an embedding layer is just a transformation from $\\mathbb{R}&#94;{inp}$ to $\\mathbb{R}&#94;{emb}$ In [ ]: embedding_dim = 100 In [ ]: model = Sequential () model . add ( Embedding ( vocabulary_size , embedding_dim , input_length = max_review_length )) #inputs will be converted from batch_size * sentence_length to batch_size*sentence_length*embedding _dim model . add ( Flatten ()) model . add ( Dense ( 250 , activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( Dense ( 1 , activation = 'sigmoid' )) model . compile ( loss = 'binary_crossentropy' , optimizer = 'adam' , metrics = [ 'accuracy' ]) print ( model . summary ()) In [ ]: # Fit the model model . fit ( X_train , y_train , validation_data = ( X_test , y_test ), epochs = 2 , batch_size = 128 , verbose = 2 ) # Final evaluation of the model scores = model . evaluate ( X_test , y_test , verbose = 0 ) print ( \"Accuracy: %.2f%% \" % ( scores [ 1 ] * 100 )) MODEL 2 : CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS Text can be thought of as 1-dimensional sequence and we can apply 1-D Convolutions over a set of words. Let us walk through convolutions on text data with this blog. http://debajyotidatta.github.io/nlp/deep/learning/word-embeddings/2016/11/27/Understanding-Convolutions-In-Text/ Fit a 1D convolution with 200 filters, kernel size 3 followed by a feedforward layer of 250 nodes and ReLU, sigmoid activations as appropriate. In [ ]: #### YOUR CODE HERE #### MODEL 3 : SIMPLE RNN Two of the best blogs that help understand the workings of a RNN and LSTM are http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ Mathematically speaking, a simple RNN does the following. It constructs a set of hidden states using the state variable from the previous timestep and the input at current time. Mathematically, a simpleRNN can be defined by the following relation. $h_t = \\sigma(W([h_{t-1},x_{t}])+b)$ If we extend this recurrence relation to the length of sequences we have in hand, we have our RNN network constructed. In [ ]: model = Sequential () model . add ( Embedding ( vocabulary_size , embedding_dim , input_length = max_review_length )) model . add ( SimpleRNN ( 100 )) model . add ( Dense ( 1 , activation = 'sigmoid' )) model . compile ( loss = 'binary_crossentropy' , optimizer = 'adam' , metrics = [ 'accuracy' ]) print ( model . summary ()) RNNs and vanishing/exploding gradients Let us use sigmoid activations as example. Derivative of a sigmoid can be written as $\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x) \\cdot \\sigma(1-x)$. Remember RNN is a \"really deep\" feedforward network (when unrolled in time). Hence, backpropagation happens from $h_t$ all the way to $h_1$. Also realize that sigmoid gradients are multiplicatively dependent on the value of sigmoid. Hence, if the non-activated output of any layer $h_l$ is < 0, then $\\sigma$ tends to 0, effectively \"vanishing\" gradient. Any layer that the current layer backprops to $H_{1:L-1}$ do not learn anything useful out of the gradients. LSTMs and GRU LSTM and GRU are two sophisticated implementations of RNN which essentially are built on what we call as gates. A gate is a probability number between 0 and 1. For instance, LSTM is built on these state updates Note : L is just a linear transformation L(x) = W*x + b. $f_t = \\sigma(L([h_{t-1},x_t))$ $i_t = \\sigma(L([h_{t-1},x_t))$ $o_t = \\sigma(L([h_{t-1},x_t))$ $\\hat{C}_t = \\tanh(L([h_{t-1},x_t))$ $C_t = f_t * C_{t-1}+i_t*\\hat{C}_t$ (Using the forget gate, the neural network can learn to control how much information it has to retain or forget) $h_t = o_t * \\tanh(c_t)$ MODEL 4 : LSTM In the next step, we will implement a LSTM model to do classification. Use the same architecture as before. Try experimenting with increasing the number of nodes, stacking multiple layers, applyong dropouts etc. Check the number of parameters that this model entails. In [ ]: #### YOUR CODE HERE #### MODEL 5 : CNN + LSTM CNNs are good at learning spatial features and sentences can be thought of as 1-D spatial vectors (dimension being connotated by the sequence ordering among the words in the sentence.). We apply a LSTM over the features learned by the CNN (after a maxpooling layer). This leverages the power of CNNs and LSTMs combined. We expect the CNN to be able to pick out invariant features across the 1-D spatial structure(i.e. sentence) that characterize good and bad sentiment. This learned spatial features may then be learned as sequences by an LSTM layer followed by a feedforward for classification. In [ ]: #### YOUR CODE HERE #### CONCLUSION We saw the power of sequence models and how they are useful in text classification. They give a solid performance, low memory footprint (thanks to shared parameters) and are able to understand and leverage the temporally connected information contained in the inputs. There is still an open debate about the performance vs memory benefits of CNNs vs RNNs in the research community. 2. 231+432 = 665.... It's not ? Let's ask our LSTM In this exercise, we are going to teach addition to our model. Given two numbers (<999), the model outputs their sum (<9999). The input is provided as a string '231+432' and the model will provide its output as ' 663' (Here the empty space is the padding character). We are not going to use any external dataset and are going to construct our own dataset for this exercise. The exercise we attempt to do effectively \"translates\" a sequence of characters '231+432' to another sequence of characters ' 663' and hence, this class of models are called sequence-to-sequence models. Such architectures have profound applications in several real-life tasks such as machine translation, summarization, image captioning etc. In [ ]: from __future__ import print_function from keras.models import Sequential from keras import layers from keras.layers import Dense , RepeatVector , TimeDistributed import numpy as np from six.moves import range The less interesting data generation and preprocessing In [ ]: class CharacterTable ( object ): def __init__ ( self , chars ): self . chars = sorted ( set ( chars )) self . char_indices = dict (( c , i ) for i , c in enumerate ( self . chars )) self . indices_char = dict (( i , c ) for i , c in enumerate ( self . chars )) #One-hot encodes def encode ( self , C , num_rows ): x = np . zeros (( num_rows , len ( self . chars ))) for i , c in enumerate ( C ): x [ i , self . char_indices [ c ]] = 1 return x #Decodes a one-hot encoding def decode ( self , x , calc_argmax = True ): if calc_argmax : x = x . argmax ( axis =- 1 ) return '' . join ( self . indices_char [ x ] for x in x ) In [ ]: TRAINING_SIZE = 50000 DIGITS = 3 MAXOUTPUTLEN = DIGITS + 1 MAXLEN = DIGITS + 1 + DIGITS chars = '0123456789+ ' ctable = CharacterTable ( chars ) In [ ]: def return_random_digit (): return np . random . choice ( list ( '0123456789' )) def generate_number (): num_digits = np . random . randint ( 1 , DIGITS + 1 ) return int ( '' . join ( return_random_digit () for i in range ( num_digits ))) def data_generate ( num_examples ): questions = [] expected = [] seen = set () print ( 'Generating data...' ) while len ( questions ) < TRAINING_SIZE : a , b = generate_number (), generate_number () #Remove already seen elements key = tuple ( sorted (( a , b ))) if key in seen : continue seen . add ( key ) # Pad the data with spaces such that it is always MAXLEN. q = ' {} + {} ' . format ( a , b ) query = q + ' ' * ( MAXLEN - len ( q )) ans = str ( a + b ) # Answers can be of maximum size DIGITS + 1. ans += ' ' * ( MAXOUTPUTLEN - len ( ans )) questions . append ( query ) expected . append ( ans ) print ( 'Total addition questions:' , len ( questions )) return questions , expected def encode_examples ( questions , answers ): x = np . zeros (( len ( questions ), MAXLEN , len ( chars )), dtype = np . bool ) y = np . zeros (( len ( questions ), DIGITS + 1 , len ( chars )), dtype = np . bool ) for i , sentence in enumerate ( questions ): x [ i ] = ctable . encode ( sentence , MAXLEN ) for i , sentence in enumerate ( answers ): y [ i ] = ctable . encode ( sentence , DIGITS + 1 ) indices = np . arange ( len ( y )) np . random . shuffle ( indices ) return x [ indices ], y [ indices ] In [ ]: q , a = data_generate ( TRAINING_SIZE ) x , y = encode_examples ( q , a ) split_at = len ( x ) - len ( x ) // 10 x_train , x_val , y_train , y_val = x [: split_at ], x [ split_at :], y [: split_at ], y [ split_at :] print ( 'Training Data shape:' ) print ( 'X : ' , x_train . shape ) print ( 'Y : ' , y_train . shape ) print ( 'Sample Question(in encoded form) : ' , x_train [ 0 ], y_train [ 0 ]) print ( 'Sample Question(in decoded form) : ' , ctable . decode ( x_train [ 0 ]), 'Sample Output : ' , ctable . decode ( y_train [ 0 ])) Let's learn two wrapper functions in Keras - TimeDistributed and RepeatVector with some dummy examples. TimeDistributed is a wrapper function call that applies an input operation on all the timesteps of an input data. For instance I have a feedforward network which converts a 10-dim vector to a 5-dim vector, then wrapping this timedistributed layer on that feedforward operation would convert a batch_size * sentence_len * vector_len(=10) to batch_size * sentence_len * output_len(=5) In [ ]: model = Sequential () #Inputs to it will be batch_size*time_steps*input_vector_dim(to Dense) . Output will be batch_size*time_steps* output_vector_dim #Here dense converts a 5-dim input vector to a 8-dim vector. model . add ( TimeDistributed ( Dense ( 8 ), input_shape = ( 3 , 5 ))) input_array = np . random . randint ( 10 , size = ( 1 , 3 , 5 )) print ( \"Shape of input : \" , input_array . shape ) model . compile ( 'rmsprop' , 'mse' ) output_array = model . predict ( input_array ) print ( \"Shape of output : \" , output_array . shape ) RepeatVector repeats the vector a specified number of times. Dimension changes from batch_size number of elements to batch_size number of repetitions * number of elements. In [ ]: model = Sequential () #converts from 1*10 to 1 * 6 model . add ( Dense ( 6 , input_dim = 10 )) print ( model . output_shape ) #converts from 1*6 to 1*3*6 model . add ( RepeatVector ( 3 )) print ( model . output_shape ) input_array = np . random . randint ( 1000 , size = ( 1 , 10 )) print ( \"Shape of input : \" , input_array . shape ) model . compile ( 'rmsprop' , 'mse' ) output_array = model . predict ( input_array ) print ( \"Shape of output : \" , output_array . shape ) # note: `None` is the batch dimension print ( 'Input : ' , input_array [ 0 ]) print ( 'Output : ' , output_array [ 0 ]) MODEL ARCHITECTURE Note : Whenever you are initializing a LSTM in Keras, by the default the option return_sequences = False. This means that at the end of the step the next component will only get to see the final hidden layer's values. On the other hand, if you set return_sequences = True, the LSTM component will return the hidden layer at each time step. It means that the next component should be able to consume inputs in that form. Think how this statement is relevant in terms of this model architecture and the TimeDistributed module we just learned.

These are AWS p2 instances with a GPU, 10GB of disk space, and 61 GB of RAM, for faster training for your networks. Most of the libraries such as keras, tensorflow, pandas, etc. are pre-installed. If a library is missing you may install it via the Terminal. NOTE : The AWS platform is funded by SEAS and FAS for the purposes of the class. It is not running against your individual credit. You are not allowed to use it for purposes not related to this course. Help us keep this service: Make sure you stop your instance as soon as you do not need it. Part 1: Parts of a Convolutional Neural Net There are three types of layers in a Convolutional Neural Network: Convolutional Layers Pooling Layers. Dropout Layers. Fully Connected Layers. a. Convolutional Layers. Convolutional layers are comprised of filters and feature maps . The filters are essentially the neurons of the layer. They have the weights and produce the input for the next layer. The feature map is the output of one filter applied to the previous layer. The fundamental difference between a densely connected layer and a convolution layer is that dense layers learn global patterns in their input feature space (for example, for an MNIST digit, patterns involving all pixels), whereas convolution layers learn local patterns: in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D windows of the inputs called receptive fields . This key characteristic gives convnets two interesting properties: The patterns they learn are translation invariant . After learning a certain pattern in the lower-right corner of a picture, a convnet can recognize it anywhere: for example, in the upper-left corner. A densely connected network would have to learn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This makes convnets data efficient when processing images (because the visual world is fundamentally translation invariant): they need fewer training samples to learn representations that have generalization power. They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns . A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolution layer will learn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows convnets to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts (because the visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical). Convolutions operate over 3D tensors, called feature maps, with two spatial axes (height and width) as well as a depth axis (also called the channels axis). For an RGB image, the dimension of the depth axis is 3, because the image has three color channels: red, green, and blue. For a black-and-white picture, like the MNIST digits, the depth is 1 (levels of gray). The convolution operation extracts patches from its input feature map and applies the same transformation to all of these patches, producing an output feature map. This output feature map is still a 3D tensor: it has a width and a height. Its depth can be arbitrary, because the output depth is a parameter of the layer, and the different channels in that depth axis no longer stand for specific colors as in RGB input; rather, they stand for filters. Filters encode specific aspects of the input data: at a high level, a single filter could encode the concept \"presence of a face in the input,\" for instance. In the MNIST example that we will see, the first convolution layer takes a feature map of size (28, 28, 1) and outputs a feature map of size (26, 26, 32): it computes 32 filters over its input. Each of these 32 output channels contains a 26×26 grid of values, which is a response map of the filter over the input, indicating the response of that filter pattern at different locations in the input. Convolutions are defined by two key parameters: Size of the patches extracted from the inputs. These are typically 3×3 or 5×5 The number of filters computed by the convolution. Padding : One of \"valid\", \"causal\" or \"same\" (case-insensitive). \"valid\" means \"no padding\". \"same\" results in padding the input such that the output has the same length as the original input. \"causal\" results in causal (dilated) convolutions, In keras see convolutional layers keras.layers.Conv2D (filters, kernel_size, strides=(1, 1), padding='valid', activation=None, use_bias=True, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', data_format='channels_last', bias_initializer='zeros') How are the values in feature maps calculated? Exercise 1: Compute the operations by hand (assuming zero padding and same arrays for all channels) to produce the first element of the 4x4 feature map. How did we get the 4x4 output size? Write this Conv layer in keras -- your answer here b. Pooling Layers. Pooling layers are also comprised of filters and feature maps. Let's say the pooling layer has a 2x2 receptive field and a stride of 2. This stride results in feature maps that are one half the size of the input feature maps. We can use a max() operation for each receptive field. In keras see pooling layers keras.layers.MaxPooling2D (pool_size=(2, 2), strides=None, padding='valid', data_format=None) c. Dropout Layers. Dropout consists in randomly setting a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. In keras see Dropout layers keras.layers.Dropout(rate, seed=None) rate: float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop. seed: A Python integer to use as random seed. References Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting d. Fully Connected Layers. A fully connected layer flattens the square feature map into a vector. Then we can use a sigmoid or softmax activation function to output probabilities of classes. In keras see FC layers keras.layers.Dense (units, activation=None, use_bias=True, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', bias_initializer='zeros') IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HYPERPARAMETERS! stride size of filter number of filters poolsize Part 2: Preprocessing the data Taking a look at how images are represented in a computer using a photo of a Picasso sculpture In [3]: img = plt . imread ( 'data/picasso.png' ) img . shape Out[3]: (150, 200, 4) In [4]: img [ 1 ,:, 1 ] Out[4]: array([0.5411765 , 0.5372549 , 0.53333336, 0.5372549 , 0.5372549 , 0.5372549 , 0.54509807, 0.4509804 , 0.41568628, 0.4392157 , 0.4509804 , 0.5372549 , 0.54901963, 0.54901963, 0.54509807, 0.54901963, 0.5411765 , 0.54509807, 0.54509807, 0.56078434, 0.56078434, 0.56078434, 0.5568628 , 0.56078434, 0.5647059 , 0.5647059 , 0.5647059 , 0.56078434, 0.5411765 , 0.53333336, 0.5372549 , 0.53333336, 0.5294118 , 0.53333336, 0.53333336, 0.5294118 , 0.53333336, 0.5372549 , 0.5411765 , 0.53333336, 0.5176471 , 0.5176471 , 0.5254902 , 0.5176471 , 0.50980395, 0.5176471 , 0.5294118 , 0.5254902 , 0.5254902 , 0.5176471 , 0.5176471 , 0.5254902 , 0.53333336, 0.53333336, 0.54509807, 0.5568628 , 0.56078434, 0.5686275 , 0.5764706 , 0.5686275 , 0.5686275 , 0.5764706 , 0.57254905, 0.5686275 , 0.5647059 , 0.56078434, 0.5529412 , 0.56078434, 0.5568628 , 0.5529412 , 0.5568628 , 0.56078434, 0.5568628 , 0.56078434, 0.5568628 , 0.54901963, 0.5411765 , 0.53333336, 0.5372549 , 0.5372549 , 0.53333336, 0.5294118 , 0.5372549 , 0.5411765 , 0.5411765 , 0.54509807, 0.5411765 , 0.54509807, 0.54509807, 0.53333336, 0.5294118 , 0.5294118 , 0.5294118 , 0.5294118 , 0.5411765 , 0.5372549 , 0.5411765 , 0.54901963, 0.5411765 , 0.5254902 , 0.5294118 , 0.5294118 , 0.5294118 , 0.52156866, 0.5137255 , 0.52156866, 0.5372549 , 0.5411765 , 0.5411765 , 0.5254902 , 0.52156866, 0.5294118 , 0.52156866, 0.5176471 , 0.5254902 , 0.5294118 , 0.5294118 , 0.52156866, 0.52156866, 0.5254902 , 0.5294118 , 0.53333336, 0.5294118 , 0.53333336, 0.5372549 , 0.53333336, 0.54509807, 0.54509807, 0.5411765 , 0.54901963, 0.5529412 , 0.5529412 , 0.54901963, 0.54509807, 0.5529412 , 0.54509807, 0.54901963, 0.54509807, 0.54509807, 0.54509807, 0.5411765 , 0.54509807, 0.54901963, 0.5529412 , 0.54509807, 0.54509807, 0.54901963, 0.5411765 , 0.54509807, 0.54901963, 0.54901963, 0.54901963, 0.54509807, 0.54509807, 0.54509807, 0.5372549 , 0.5411765 , 0.5411765 , 0.5372549 , 0.5372549 , 0.5372549 , 0.5372549 , 0.5411765 , 0.5294118 , 0.53333336, 0.5372549 , 0.54509807, 0.5372549 , 0.53333336, 0.5294118 , 0.52156866, 0.5254902 , 0.50980395, 0.5176471 , 0.5176471 , 0.5176471 , 0.5254902 , 0.52156866, 0.5176471 , 0.5254902 , 0.53333336, 0.53333336, 0.5176471 , 0.50980395, 0.5176471 , 0.50980395, 0.5176471 , 0.5137255 , 0.5137255 , 0.5137255 , 0.5058824 , 0.5019608 , 0.5137255 , 0.5058824 , 0.49803922, 0.5058824 , 0.48235294, 0.48235294, 0.47058824, 0.48235294], dtype=float32) In [5]: print ( type ( img [ 50 ][ 0 ][ 0 ])) In [6]: # let's see the image imgplot = plt . imshow ( img ) Visualizing the channels In [7]: R_img = img [:,:, 0 ] G_img = img [:,:, 1 ] B_img = img [:,:, 2 ] plt . subplot ( 221 ) plt . imshow ( R_img , cmap = plt . cm .

These classifiers process vectors, which are 1D, whereas the current output is a 3D tensor. First we have to flatten the 3D outputs to 1D, and then add a few Dense layers on top.

Not bad! But why does this simple convnet work so well, compared to a densely connected model? The answer is above on how convolutional layers work! Data Preprocessing : Meet the ImageDataGenerator class in keras (docs) The MNIST and other pre-loaded dataset are formatted in a way that is almost ready for feeding into the model. What about plain images? They should be formatted into appropriately preprocessed floating-point tensors before being fed into the network. The Dogs vs. Cats dataset that you'll use isn't packaged with Keras. It was made available by Kaggle as part of a computer-vision competition in late 2013, back when convnets weren't mainstream. The data has been downloaded for you from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data The pictures are medium-resolution color JPEGs. In [14]: # TODO: set your base dir to your correct local location base_dir = 'data/cats_and_dogs_small' import os , shutil # Set up directory information train_dir = os . path . join ( base_dir , 'train' ) validation_dir = os . path . join ( base_dir , 'validation' ) test_dir = os . path . join ( base_dir , 'test' ) train_cats_dir = os . path . join ( train_dir , 'cats' ) train_dogs_dir = os . path . join ( train_dir , 'dogs' ) validation_cats_dir = os . path . join ( validation_dir , 'cats' ) validation_dogs_dir = os . path . join ( validation_dir , 'dogs' ) test_cats_dir = os . path . join ( test_dir , 'cats' ) test_dogs_dir = os . path . join ( test_dir , 'dogs' ) print ( 'total training cat images:' , len ( os . listdir ( train_cats_dir ))) print ( 'total training dog images:' , len ( os . listdir ( train_dogs_dir ))) print ( 'total validation cat images:' , len ( os . listdir ( validation_cats_dir ))) print ( 'total validation dog images:' , len ( os . listdir ( validation_dogs_dir ))) print ( 'total test cat images:' , len ( os . listdir ( test_cats_dir ))) print ( 'total test dog images:' , len ( os . listdir ( test_dogs_dir ))) total training cat images: 1000 total training dog images: 1000 total validation cat images: 500 total validation dog images: 500 total test cat images: 500 total test dog images: 500 So you do indeed have 2,000 training images, 1,000 validation images, and 1,000 test images. Each split contains the same number of samples from each class: this is a balanced binary-classification problem, which means classification accuracy will be an appropriate measure of success.

Because you ended the network with a single sigmoid unit, you'll use binary crossentropy as the loss. In [16]: from keras import optimizers model . compile ( loss = 'binary_crossentropy' , optimizer = optimizers . RMSprop ( lr = 1e-4 ), metrics = [ 'acc' ]) The steps for getting it into the network are roughly as follows: Read the picture files. Decode the JPEG content to RGB grids of pixels. Convert these into floating-point tensors. Rescale the pixel values (between 0 and 255) to the [0, 1] interval (as you know, neural networks prefer to deal with small input values). It may seem a bit daunting, but fortunately Keras has utilities to take care of these steps automatically with the class ImageDataGenerator , which lets you quickly set up Python generators that can automatically turn image files on disk into batches of preprocessed tensors. This is what you'll use here. In [17]: from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator ( rescale = 1. / 255 ) test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator ( rescale = 1. / 255 ) train_generator = train_datagen . flow_from_directory ( train_dir , target_size = ( 150 , 150 ), batch_size = 20 , class_mode = 'binary' ) validation_generator = test_datagen . flow_from_directory ( validation_dir , target_size = ( 150 , 150 ), batch_size = 20 , class_mode = 'binary' ) Found 2000 images belonging to 2 classes. Found 1000 images belonging to 2 classes. Let's look at the output of one of these generators: it yields batches of 150×150 RGB images (shape (20, 150, 150, 3)) and binary labels (shape (20,)). There are 20 samples in each batch (the batch size). Note that the generator yields these batches indefinitely: it loops endlessly over the images in the target folder. For this reason, you need to break the iteration loop at some point: In [18]: for data_batch , labels_batch in train_generator : print ( 'data batch shape:' , data_batch . shape ) print ( 'labels batch shape:' , labels_batch . shape ) break data batch shape: (20, 150, 150, 3) labels batch shape: (20,) Let's fit the model to the data using the generator. You do so using the .fit_generator method, the equivalent of .fit for data generators like this one. It expects as its first argument a Python generator that will yield batches of inputs and targets indefinitely, like this one does. Because the data is being generated endlessly, the Keras model needs to know how many samples to draw from the generator before declaring an epoch over. This is the role of the steps_per_epoch argument: after having drawn steps_per_epoch batches from the generator—that is, after having run for steps_per_epoch gradient descent steps - the fitting process will go to the next epoch. In this case, batches are 20 samples, so it will take 100 batches until you see your target of 2,000 samples. When using fit_generator, you can pass a validation_data argument, much as with the fit method. It's important to note that this argument is allowed to be a data generator, but it could also be a tuple of Numpy arrays. If you pass a generator as validation_data, then this generator is expected to yield batches of validation data endlessly; thus you should also specify the validation_steps argument, which tells the process how many batches to draw from the validation generator for evaluation In [19]: history = model . fit_generator ( train_generator , steps_per_epoch = 100 , epochs = 5 , # TODO: should be 30 validation_data = validation_generator , validation_steps = 50 ) # It's good practice to always save your models after training. model . save ( 'cats_and_dogs_small_1.h5' ) Epoch 1/5 100/100 [==============================] - 55s 549ms/step - loss: 0.6885 - acc: 0.5320 - val_loss: 0.6711 - val_acc: 0.6220 Epoch 2/5 100/100 [==============================] - 56s 558ms/step - loss: 0.6620 - acc: 0.5950 - val_loss: 0.6500 - val_acc: 0.6170 Epoch 3/5 100/100 [==============================] - 56s 562ms/step - loss: 0.6198 - acc: 0.6510 - val_loss: 0.6771 - val_acc: 0.5790 Epoch 4/5 100/100 [==============================] - 57s 567ms/step - loss: 0.5733 - acc: 0.6955 - val_loss: 0.5993 - val_acc: 0.6740 Epoch 5/5 100/100 [==============================] - 57s 566ms/step - loss: 0.5350 - acc: 0.7305 - val_loss: 0.6140 - val_acc: 0.6520 Let's plot the loss and accuracy of the model over the training and validation data during training: In [20]: fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 6 )) ax . plot (( history . history [ 'acc' ]), 'r' , label = 'train' ) ax . plot (( history . history [ 'val_acc' ]), 'b' , label = 'val' ) ax . set_xlabel ( r 'Epoch' , fontsize = 20 ) ax . set_ylabel ( r 'Accuracy' , fontsize = 20 ) ax . legend () ax . tick_params ( labelsize = 20 ) Let's try data augmentation In [21]: datagen = ImageDataGenerator ( rotation_range = 40 , width_shift_range = 0.2 , height_shift_range = 0.2 , shear_range = 0.2 , zoom_range = 0.2 , horizontal_flip = True , fill_mode = 'nearest' ) These are just a few of the options available (for more, see the Keras documentation). Let's quickly go over this code: rotation_range is a value in degrees (0–180), a range within which to randomly rotate pictures. width_shift and height_shift are ranges (as a fraction of total width or height) within which to randomly translate pictures vertically or horizontally. shear_range is for randomly applying shearing transformations. zoom_range is for randomly zooming inside pictures. horizontal_flip is for randomly flipping half the images horizontally—relevant when there are no assumptions of - horizontal asymmetry (for example, real-world pictures). fill_mode is the strategy used for filling in newly created pixels, which can appear after a rotation or a width/height shift. Let's look at the augmented images In [22]: from keras.preprocessing import image fnames = [ os . path . join ( train_dogs_dir , fname ) for fname in os . listdir ( train_dogs_dir )] img_path = fnames [ 3 ] # Chooses one image to augment img = image . load_img ( img_path , target_size = ( 150 , 150 )) # Reads the image and resizes it x = image . img_to_array ( img ) # Converts it to a Numpy array with shape (150, 150, 3) x = x . reshape (( 1 ,) + x . shape ) # Reshapes it to (1, 150, 150, 3) i = 0 for batch in datagen . flow ( x , batch_size = 1 ): plt . figure ( i ) imgplot = plt . imshow ( image . array_to_img ( batch [ 0 ])) i += 1 if i % 4 == 0 : break plt . show () If you train a new network using this data-augmentation configuration, the network will never see the same input twice. But the inputs it sees are still heavily intercorrelated, because they come from a small number of original images—you can't produce new information, you can only remix existing information. As such, this may not be enough to completely get rid of overfitting. To further fight overfitting, you'll also add a Dropout layer to your model right before the densely connected classifier. In [23]: model = models . Sequential () model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 32 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' , input_shape = ( 150 , 150 , 3 ))) model . add ( layers .

Found 1000 images belonging to 2 classes. Epoch 1/5 100/100 [==============================] - 94s 935ms/step - loss: 0.6902 - acc: 0.5294 - val_loss: 0.7003 - val_acc: 0.4924 Epoch 2/5 100/100 [==============================] - 88s 882ms/step - loss: 0.6763 - acc: 0.5703 - val_loss: 0.7350 - val_acc: 0.5090 Epoch 3/5 100/100 [==============================] - 90s 899ms/step - loss: 0.6681 - acc: 0.5816 - val_loss: 0.6458 - val_acc: 0.6098 Epoch 4/5 100/100 [==============================] - 88s 877ms/step - loss: 0.6496 - acc: 0.6241 - val_loss: 0.6431 - val_acc: 0.6192 Epoch 5/5 100/100 [==============================] - 89s 886ms/step - loss: 0.6298 - acc: 0.6369 - val_loss: 0.5897 - val_acc: 0.6580 And let's plot the results again. Thanks to data augmentation and dropout, you're no longer overfitting: the training curves are closely tracking the validation curves. You now reach an accuracy of 82%, a 15% relative improvement over the non-regularized model. (Note: these numbers are for 100 epochs..) In [25]: fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 6 )) ax . plot (( history . history [ 'acc' ]), 'r' , label = 'train' ) ax . plot (( history . history [ 'val_acc' ]), 'b' , label = 'val' ) ax . set_xlabel ( r 'Epoch' , fontsize = 20 ) ax . set_ylabel ( r 'Accuracy' , fontsize = 20 ) ax . legend () ax . tick_params ( labelsize = 20 ) By using regularization techniques even further, and by tuning the network's parameters (such as the number of filters per convolution layer, or the number of layers in the network), you may be able to get an even better accuracy, likely up to 86% or 87%. But it would prove difficult to go any higher just by training your own convnet from scratch, because you have so little data to work with. As a next step to improve your accuracy on this problem, you'll have to use a pretrained model.

background-color: #DDDDDD; color: black; } In this example, we will try to implement a CNN for text. We will use the task of IMDB movie review classification. Response variable is positive/negative review. A sentence can be thought of as a sequence of words which have semantic connections across time. By semantic connection, we mean that the words that occur earlier in the sentence influence the sentence's structure and meaning in the latter part of the sentence. Note: There are also semantic connections backwards in a sentence (we will revisit this idea when we do RNNs from both directions and combine their outputs which we will see in the next few lectures).

WHY SEEDING ? Most random number generators in computers are pseudo-random number generators i.e. they generate random numbers starting from a seed, but internally have a deterministic formula to calculate the next random number it generates and thus, if you fix your seed, the set of random numbers produced are the same in every run. STEP 1 : Load and visualize the data In [43]: # We want to have a finite vocabulary (9,999 most frequent words, one for everything else) vocabulary_size = 10000 #We also want to have a finite length of reviews and not have to process really long sentences. # Anything longer will be chopped! max_review_length = 500 For practical data science applications, we need to convert text into tokens since the machine understands only numbers and not really English words like humans can. As a simple example of tokenization, we can see a small example. Assume we have 5 sentences. This is how we tokenize them into numbers once we create a dictionary. I have books - [1, 4, 7] Interesting books are useful [10,2,9,8] I have computers [1,4,6] Computers are interesting and useful [6,9,11,10,8] Books and computers are both valuable. [7,10,2,9,13,12] Create tokens for vocabulary based on frequency of occurrence. Hence, we assign the following tokens I-1, books-2, computers-3, have-4, are-5, computers-6,books-7, useful-8, are-9, and-10,interesting-11, valuable-12, both-13 Thankfully, in our dataset it is internally handled and each sentence is represented in such tokenized form.

Hint : Tokenization. Obvious Workaround : One-Hot Encodings EMBEDDINGS - Sparse to Dense Transformations We use embeddings to reduce dimensions of our data since the tokens we assign based on our word frequency are discrete and do not have a continuous structure. What are embeddings ? Embeddings are functional transformations from a sparse discrete vector representation of text (either as tokens or as one-hot encodings) into a dense vector representation of a fixed size(usually of much lower dimensions than the vocabulary length of the text). The dense representations allow the neural network to generalize better. Here we are training our own embedding while training our neural network. To transfer \"knowledge\" from other sources, in more complicated projects we can also use pre-trained embeddings such as word-2-vec, GloVE, Fastext etc. https://nlpforhackers.io/word-embeddings/ Example Embeddings Transformation Let us first understand how Keras embedding layer works through a dummy example to see how the dimensions are transformed. In this example, each input is mapped to a 64 dimensional vector (via the embedding layer).

We'll also explore the use of cross-validation as a technique for checking potential values for these hyperparameters. By the end of this lab, you should: Be familiar with the use of sklearn 's optimize function. Be able to identify the hyperparameters that go into the training of a MLP. Be familiar with the implementation in keras of various optimization techniques. Know how to use callbacks Apply cross-validation to check for multiple values of hyperparameters. In [2]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from scipy.optimize import minimize % matplotlib inline Part 1: Beale's function First let's look at function optimization in scipy.optimize , using Beale's function as an example Optimizing a function $f: A\\rightarrow R$, from some set A to the real numbers is finding an element $x_0\\,\\epsilon\\, A$ such that $f(x_0)\\leq f(x)$ for all $x\\,\\epsilon\\, A$ (finding the minimum) or such that $f(x_0)\\geq f(x)$ for all $x\\,\\epsilon\\, A$ (finding the maximum). To illustrate our point we will use a function of two parameters. Our goal is to optimize over these 2 parameters. We can extend to higher dimensions by plotting pairs of parameters against each other. The Wikipedia article on Test functions for optimization has a few functions that are useful for evaluating optimization algorithms. Here is Beale's function: $f(x,y)$ = $(1.5−x+xy)&#94;2+(2.25−x+xy&#94;2)&#94;2+(2.625−x+xy&#94;3)&#94;2$ We already know that this function has a minimum at [3.0, 0.5]. Let's see if scipy will find it. source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization In [3]: # define Beale's function which we want to minimize def objective ( X ): x = X [ 0 ]; y = X [ 1 ] return ( 1.5 - x + x * y ) ** 2 + ( 2.25 - x + x * y ** 2 ) ** 2 + ( 2.625 - x + x * y ** 3 ) ** 2 In [4]: # function boundaries xmin , xmax , xstep = - 4.5 , 4.5 , . 9 ymin , ymax , ystep = - 4.5 , 4.5 , . 9 In [5]: # Let's create some points x1 , y1 = np . meshgrid ( np . arange ( xmin , xmax + xstep , xstep ), np . arange ( ymin , ymax + ystep , ystep )) Let's make an initial guess In [6]: # initial guess x0 = [ 4. , 4. ] f0 = objective ( x0 ) print ( f0 ) 68891.203125 In [7]: bnds = (( xmin , xmax ), ( ymin , ymax )) minimum = minimize ( objective , x0 , bounds = bnds ) In [8]: print ( minimum ) fun: 2.068025638865627e-12 hess_inv: <2x2 LbfgsInvHessProduct with dtype=float64> jac: array([-1.55969780e-06, 9.89837957e-06]) message: b'CONVERGENCE: NORM_OF_PROJECTED_GRADIENT_<=_PGTOL' nfev: 60 nit: 14 status: 0 success: True x: array([3.00000257, 0.50000085]) In [9]: real_min = [ 3.0 , 0.5 ] print ( f 'The answer, {minimum.x} , is very close to the optimum as we know it, which is {real_min} ' ) print ( f 'The value of the objective for {real_min} is {objective(real_min)}' ) The answer, [3.00000257 0.50000085], is very close to the optimum as we know it, which is [3.0, 0.5] The value of the objective for [3.0, 0.5] is 0.0 Part 2: Optimization in neural networks In general: Learning Representation --> Objective function --> Optimization algorithm A neural network can be defined as a framework that combines inputs and tries to guess the output. If we are lucky enough to have some results, called \"the ground truth\", to compare the outputs produced by the network, we can calculate the error . So the network guesses, calculates some error function, guesses again, trying to minimize this error, guesses again, until the error does not go down any more. This is optimization. In neural networks the most common used optimization algorithms, are flavors of GD (gradient descent) . The objective function used in gradient descent is the loss function which we want to minimize . A keras Refresher Keras is a Python library for deep learning that can run on top of both Theano or TensorFlow, two powerful Python libraries for fast numerical computing created and released by Facebook and Google, respectevely. Keras was developed to make developing deep learning models as fast and easy as possible for research and practical applications. It runs on Python 2.7 or 3.5 and can seamlessly execute on GPUs and CPUs. Keras is built on the idea of a model. At its core we have a sequence of layers called the Sequential model which is a linear stack of layers. Keras also provides the functional API , a way to define complex models, such as multi-output models, directed acyclic graphs, or models with shared layers. We can summarize the construction of deep learning models in Keras using the Sequential model as follows: Define your model : create a Sequential model and add layers. Compile your model : specify loss function and optimizers and call the .compile() function. Fit your model : train the model on data by calling the .fit() function. Make predictions : use the model to generate predictions on new data by calling functions such as .evaluate() or .predict() . Callbacks: taking a peek into our model while it's training You can look at what is happening in various stages of your model by using callbacks . A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training. You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument callbacks) to the .fit() method of the Sequential or Model classes. The relevant methods of the callbacks will then be called at each stage of the training. A callback function you are already familiar with is keras.callbacks.History() . This is automatically included in .fit() . Another very useful one is keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint which saves the model with its weights at a certain point in the training. This can prove useful if your model is running for a long time and a system failure happens. Not all is lost then. It's a good practice to save the model weights only when an improvement is observed as measured by the acc , for example. keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping stops the training when a monitored quantity has stopped improving. keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler will change the learning rate during training. We will apply some callbacks later. For full documentation on callbacks see https://keras.io/callbacks/ What are the steps to optimizing our network?

Each pixel is 8 bits so its value ranges from 0 to 255. In [12]: #mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist mnist = keras . datasets . mnist ( x_train , y_train ),( x_test , y_test ) = mnist . load_data () x_train . shape , y_train . shape Out[12]: ((60000, 28, 28), (60000,)) Each label is a number between 0 and 9 In [13]: print ( y_train ) [5 0 4 ... 5 6 8] Let's look at some 10 of the images In [14]: plt . figure ( figsize = ( 10 , 10 )) for i in range ( 10 ): plt . subplot ( 5 , 5 , i + 1 ) plt . xticks ([]) plt . yticks ([]) plt . grid ( False ) plt . imshow ( x_train [ i ], cmap = plt . cm . binary ) plt . xlabel ( y_train [ i ]) In [15]: x_train [ 45 ] . shape x_train [ 45 , 15 : 20 , 15 : 20 ] Out[15]: array([[ 11, 198, 231, 41, 0], [ 82, 252, 204, 0, 0], [253, 253, 141, 0, 0], [252, 220, 36, 0, 0], [252, 96, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint8) In [17]: print ( f 'We have {x_train.shape[0]} train samples' ) print ( f 'We have {x_test.shape[0]} test samples' ) We have 60000 train samples We have 10000 test samples Preprocessing the data To run our NN we need to pre-process the data First we need to make the 2D image arrays into 1D (flatten them). We can either perform this by using array reshaping with numpy.reshape() or the keras ' method for this: a layer called tf.keras.layers.Flatten which transforms the format of the images from a 2d-array (of 28 by 28 pixels), to a 1D-array of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels. Then we need to normalize the pixel values (give them values between 0 and 1) using the following transformation: \\begin{align} x := \\dfrac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}} \\textrm{} \\end{align} In our case $x_{min} = 0$ and $x_{max} = 255$ so the formula becomes simply $x := {x}/255$ In [18]: # normalize the data x_train , x_test = x_train / 255.0 , x_test / 255.0 In [19]: # reshape the data into 1D vectors x_train = x_train . reshape ( 60000 , 784 ) x_test = x_test . reshape ( 10000 , 784 ) num_classes = 10 In [20]: x_train . shape [ 1 ] Out[20]: 784 Now let's prepare our class vector (y) to a binary class matrix, e.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy. In [21]: # Convert class vectors to binary class matrices y_train = keras . utils . to_categorical ( y_train , num_classes ) y_test = keras . utils . to_categorical ( y_test , num_classes ) In [22]: y_train [ 0 ] Out[22]: array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.], dtype=float32) Now we are ready to build the model! Step 2 - Adjusting the learning rate One of the most common optimization algorithm is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The hyperparameters that can be optimized in SGD are learning rate , momentum , decay and nesterov . Learning rate controls the weight at the end of each batch, and momentum controls how much to let the previous update influence the current weight update. Decay indicates the learning rate decay over each update, and nesterov takes the value True or False depending on if we want to apply Nesterov momentum. Typical values for those hyperparameters are lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, and nesterov=True. The learning rate hyperparameter goes into the optimizer function which we will see below. Keras has a default learning rate scheduler in the SGD optimizer that decreases the learning rate during the stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm. The learning rate is decreased according to this formula: \\begin{align} lr = lr * 1./(1. + decay * epoch) \\textrm{} \\end{align} source: http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3 Let's implement a learning rate adaptation schedule in Keras . We'll start with SGD and a learning rate value of 0.1. We will then train the model for 60 epochs and set the decay argument to 0.0016 (0.1/60). We also include a momentum value of 0.8 since that seems to work well when using an adaptive learning rate. In [23]: epochs = 60 learning_rate = 0.1 decay_rate = learning_rate / epochs momentum = 0.8 sgd = SGD ( lr = learning_rate , momentum = momentum , decay = decay_rate , nesterov = False ) In [24]: # build the model input_dim = x_train . shape [ 1 ] lr_model = Sequential () lr_model . add ( Dense ( 64 , activation = tf . nn . relu , kernel_initializer = 'uniform' , input_dim = input_dim )) lr_model . add ( Dropout ( 0.1 )) lr_model . add ( Dense ( 64 , kernel_initializer = 'uniform' , activation = tf . nn . relu )) lr_model . add ( Dense ( num_classes , kernel_initializer = 'uniform' , activation = tf . nn . softmax )) # compile the model lr_model . compile ( loss = 'categorical_crossentropy' , optimizer = sgd , metrics = [ 'acc' ]) In [25]: %% time # Fit the model batch_size = int(input_dim/100) lr_model_history = lr_model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, verbose=1, validation_data=(x_test, y_test)) Train on 60000 samples, validate on 10000 samples Epoch 1/60 60000/60000 [==============================] -

Choosing an optimizer and a loss function When constructing a model and using it to make our predictions, for example to assign label scores to images (\"cat\", \"plane\", etc), we want to measure our success or failure by defining a \"loss\" function (or objective function). The goal of optimization is to efficiently calculate the parameters/weights that minimize this loss function. keras provides various types of loss functions . Sometimes the \"loss\" function measures the \"distance\". We can define this \"distance\" between two data points in various ways suitable to the problem or dataset. Distance Euclidean Manhattan others such as Hamming which measures distances between strings, for example. The Hamming distance of \"carolin\" and \"cathrin\" is 3.

Random restarts This method does not seem to have an implementation in keras . We will leave it as a home exercise! Hint: you can use keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler . See how we used it to set a custom learning rate. Tuning the Hyperparameters using Cross Validation Now instead of trying different values by hand, we will use GridSearchCV from Scikit-Learn to try out several values for our hyperparameters and compare the results. To do cross-validation with keras we will use the wrappers for the Scikit-Learn API. They provide a way to use Sequential Keras models (single-input only) as part of your Scikit-Learn workflow. There are two wrappers available: keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasClassifier(build_fn=None, **sk_params) , which implements the Scikit-Learn classifier interface, keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasRegressor(build_fn=None, **sk_params) , which implements the Scikit-Learn regressor interface.

You can install HDF5 Python module: pip install h5py Keras gives you the ability to describe and save any model using the JSON format. In [51]: from keras.models import model_from_json # serialize model to JSON model_json = model . to_json () with open ( \"model.json\" , \"w\" ) as json_file : json_file . write ( model_json ) # save weights to HDF5 model . save_weights ( \"model.h5\" ) print ( \"Model saved\" ) # when you want to retrieve the model: load json and create model json_file = open ( 'model.json' , 'r' ) saved_model = json_file . read () # close the file as good practice json_file . close () model_from_json = model_from_json ( saved_model ) # load weights into new model model_from_json . load_weights ( \"model.h5\" ) print ( \"Model loaded\" ) Model saved Model loaded Exercise 2: Cross-validation with more than one hyperparameters We can do cross-validation with more than one parameters simultaneously, effectively trying out combinations of them. Note: Cross-validation in neural networks is computationally expensive . Think before you experiment! Multiply the number of features you are validating on to see how many combinations there are. Each combination is evaluated using the cv-fold cross-validation (cv is a parameter we choose). For example, we can choose to search for different values of: batch size, number of epochs and initialization mode. The choises are specifed into a dictionary and passed to GridSearchCV. Perform a GridSearch for batch size , number of epochs and initializer combined.

We'll also explore the use of cross-validation as a technique for checking potential values for these hyperparameters. By the end of this lab, you should: Be familiar with the use of sklearn 's optimize function. Be able to identify the hyperparameters that go into the training of a MLP. Be familiar with the implementation in keras of various optimization techniques. Apply cross-validation to check for multiple values of hyperparameters. In [2]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from scipy.optimize import minimize % matplotlib inline Part 1: Beale's function First let's look at function optimization in scipy.optimize , using Beale's function as an example Optimizing a function $f: A\\rightarrow R$, from some set A to the real numbers is finding an element $x_0\\,\\epsilon\\, A$ such that $f(x_0)\\leq f(x)$ for all $x\\,\\epsilon\\, A$ (finding the minimum) or such that $f(x_0)\\geq f(x)$ for all $x\\,\\epsilon\\, A$ (finding the maximum). To illustrate our point we will use a function of two parameters. Our goal is to optimize over these 2 parameters. We can extend to higher dimensions by plotting pairs of parameters against each other. The Wikipedia article on Test functions for optimization has a few functions that are useful for evaluating optimization algorithms. Here is Beale's function: $f(x,y)$ = $(1.5−x+xy)&#94;2+(2.25−x+xy&#94;2)&#94;2+(2.625−x+xy&#94;3)&#94;2$ [source: Wikipedia ] We already know that this function has a minimum at [3.0, 0.5]. Let's see if scipy will find it. In [3]: # define Beale's function which we want to minimize def objective ( X ): x = X [ 0 ]; y = X [ 1 ] return ( 1.5 - x + x * y ) ** 2 + ( 2.25 - x + x * y ** 2 ) ** 2 + ( 2.625 - x + x * y ** 3 ) ** 2 In [4]: # function boundaries xmin , xmax , xstep = - 4.5 , 4.5 , . 9 ymin , ymax , ystep = - 4.5 , 4.5 , . 9 In [5]: # Let's create some points x1 , y1 = np . meshgrid ( np . arange ( xmin , xmax + xstep , xstep ), np . arange ( ymin , ymax + ystep , ystep )) Let's make an initial guess In [6]: # initial guess x0 = [ 4. , 4. ] f0 = objective ( x0 ) print ( f0 ) 68891.203125 In [7]: bnds = (( xmin , xmax ), ( ymin , ymax )) minimum = minimize ( objective , x0 , bounds = bnds ) In [8]: print ( minimum ) fun: 2.068025638865627e-12 hess_inv: <2x2 LbfgsInvHessProduct with dtype=float64> jac: array([-1.55969780e-06, 9.89837957e-06]) message: b'CONVERGENCE: NORM_OF_PROJECTED_GRADIENT_<=_PGTOL' nfev: 60 nit: 14 status: 0 success: True x: array([3.00000257, 0.50000085]) In [9]: real_min = [ 3.0 , 0.5 ] print ( f 'The answer, {minimum.x} , is very close to the optimum as we know it, which is {real_min} ' ) print ( f 'The value of the objective for {real_min} is {objective(real_min)}' ) The answer, [3.00000257 0.50000085], is very close to the optimum as we know it, which is [3.0, 0.5] The value of the objective for [3.0, 0.5] is 0.0 Part 2: Optimization in neural networks In general: Learning Representation --> Objective function --> Optimization algorithm A neural network can be defined as a framework that combines inputs and tries to guess the output. If we are lucky enough to have some results, called \"the ground truth\", to compare the outputs produced by the network, we can calculate the error . So the network guesses, calculates some error function, guesses again, trying to minimize this error, guesses again, until the error does not go down any more. This is optimization. In neural networks the most common used optimization algorithms, are flavors of GD (gradient descent) . The objective function used in gradient descent is the loss function which we want to minimize . A keras Refresher Keras is a Python library for deep learning that can run on top of both Theano or TensorFlow, two powerful Python libraries for fast numerical computing created and released by Facebook and Google, respectevely. Keras was developed to make developing deep learning models as fast and easy as possible for research and practical applications. It runs on Python 2.7 or 3.5 and can seamlessly execute on GPUs and CPUs. Keras is built on the idea of a model. At its core we have a sequence of layers called the Sequential model which is a linear stack of layers. Keras also provides the functional API , a way to define complex models, such as multi-output models, directed acyclic graphs, or models with shared layers. We can summarize the construction of deep learning models in Keras using the Sequential model as follows: Define your model : create a Sequential model and add layers. Compile your model : specify loss function and optimizers and call the .compile() function. Fit your model : train the model on data by calling the .fit() function. Make predictions : use the model to generate predictions on new data by calling functions such as .evaluate() or .predict() . Callbacks: taking a peek into our model while it's training You can look at what is happening in various stages of your model by using callbacks . A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training. You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument callbacks) to the .fit() method of the Sequential or Model classes. The relevant methods of the callbacks will then be called at each stage of the training. A callback function you are already familiar with is keras.callbacks.History() . This is automatically included in .fit() . Another very useful one is keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint which saves the model with its weights at a certain point in the training. This can prove useful if your model is running for a long time and a system failure happens. Not all is lost then. It's a good practice to save the model weights only when an improvement is observed as measured by the acc , for example. keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping stops the training when a monitored quantity has stopped improving. keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler will change the learning rate during training. We will apply some callbacks later. For full documentation on callbacks see https://keras.io/callbacks/ What are the steps to optimizing our network?

In [11]: #mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist mnist = keras . datasets . mnist ( x_train , y_train ),( x_test , y_test ) = mnist . load_data () x_train . shape , y_train . shape Out[11]: ((60000, 28, 28), (60000,)) Each label is a number between 0 and 9 In [12]: print ( y_train ) [5 0 4 ... 5 6 8] Let's look at some 10 of the images In [13]: plt . figure ( figsize = ( 10 , 10 )) for i in range ( 10 ): plt . subplot ( 5 , 5 , i + 1 ) plt . xticks ([]) plt . yticks ([]) plt . grid ( False ) plt . imshow ( x_train [ i ], cmap = plt . cm . binary ) plt . xlabel ( y_train [ i ]) In [14]: x_train [ 45 ] . shape x_train [ 45 , 15 : 20 , 15 : 20 ] Out[14]: array([[ 11, 198, 231, 41, 0], [ 82, 252, 204, 0, 0], [253, 253, 141, 0, 0], [252, 220, 36, 0, 0], [252, 96, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint8) In [15]: print ( f 'We have {x_train.shape[0]} train samples' ) print ( f 'We have {x_test.shape[0]} test samples' ) We have 60000 train samples We have 10000 test samples Preprocessing the data To run our NN we need to pre-process the data First we need to make the 2D image arrays into 1D (flatten them). We can either perform this by using array reshaping with numpy.reshape() or the keras ' method for this: a layer called tf.keras.layers.Flatten which transforms the format of the images from a 2d-array (of 28 by 28 pixels), to a 1D-array of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels. Then we need to normalize the pixel values (give them values between 0 and 1) using the following transformation: \\begin{align} x := \\dfrac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}} \\textrm{} \\end{align} In our case $x_{min} = 0$ and $x_{max} = 255$ so the formula becomes simply $x := {x}/255$ In [16]: # normalize the data x_train , x_test = x_train / 255.0 , x_test / 255.0 In [17]: # reshape the data into 1D vectors x_train = x_train . reshape ( 60000 , 784 ) x_test = x_test . reshape ( 10000 , 784 ) num_classes = 10 In [18]: x_train . shape [ 1 ] Out[18]: 784 Now let's prepare our class vector (y) to a binary class matrix, e.g. for use with categorical_crossentropy. In [19]: # Convert class vectors to binary class matrices y_train = keras . utils . to_categorical ( y_train , num_classes ) y_test = keras . utils . to_categorical ( y_test , num_classes ) In [20]: y_train [ 0 ] Out[20]: array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.], dtype=float32) Now we are ready to build the model! Step 2 - Adjusting the learning rate One of the most common optimization algorithm is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The hyperparameters that can be optimized in SGD are learning rate , momentum , decay and nesterov . Learning rate controls the weight at the end of each batch, and momentum controls how much to let the previous update influence the current weight update. Decay indicates the learning rate decay over each update, and nesterov takes the value True or False depending on if we want to apply Nesterov momentum. Typical values for those hyperparameters are lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, and nesterov=True. The learning rate hyperparameter goes into the optimizer function which we will see below. Let's implement a learning rate adaptation schedule in Keras . We'll start with SGD and a learning rate value of 0.1. We will then train the model for 40 epochs and set the decay argument to 0.002 (0.1/50). We also include a momentum value of 0.8 since that seems to work well when using an adaptive learning rate. In [21]: epochs = 60 learning_rate = 0.1 decay_rate = learning_rate / epochs momentum = 0.8 sgd = SGD ( lr = learning_rate , momentum = momentum , decay = decay_rate , nesterov = False ) In [22]: # build the model input_dim = x_train . shape [ 1 ] lr_model = Sequential () lr_model . add ( Dense ( 64 , activation = tf . nn . relu , kernel_initializer = 'uniform' , input_dim = input_dim )) # fully-connected layer with 64 hidden units lr_model . add ( Dense ( 64 , kernel_initializer = 'uniform' , activation = tf . nn . relu )) lr_model . add ( Dense ( num_classes , kernel_initializer = 'uniform' , activation = tf . nn . softmax )) # compile the model lr_model . compile ( loss = 'categorical_crossentropy' , optimizer = sgd , metrics = [ 'acc' ]) In [23]: %% time # Fit the model batch_size = 28 lr_model_history = lr_model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, verbose=1, validation_data=(x_test, y_test)) Train on 60000 samples, validate on 10000 samples Epoch 1/60 60000/60000 [==============================] -

Choosing an optimizer and a loss function When constructing a model and using it to make our predictions, for example to assign label scores to images (\"cat\", \"plane\", etc), we want to measure our success or failure by defining a \"loss\" function (or objective function). The goal of optimization is to efficiently calculate the parameters/weights that minimize this loss function. keras provides various types of loss functions . Sometimes the \"loss\" function measures the \"distance\". We can define this \"distance\" between two data points in various ways suitable to the problem or dataset. Distance Euclidean Manhattan others such as Hamming which measures distances between strings, for example. The Hamming distance of \"carolin\" and \"cathrin\" is 3.

Random restarts This method does not seem to have an implementation in keras . We will leave it as a home exercise! Hint: you can use keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler . Tuning the Hyperparameters using Cross Validation Now instead of trying different values by hand, we will use GridSearchCV from Scikit-Learn to try out several values for our hyperparameters and compare the results. To do cross-validation with keras we will use the wrappers for the Scikit-Learn API. They provide a way to use Sequential Keras models (single-input only) as part of your Scikit-Learn workflow. There are two wrappers available: keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasClassifier(build_fn=None, **sk_params) , which implements the Scikit-Learn classifier interface, keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasRegressor(build_fn=None, **sk_params) , which implements the Scikit-Learn regressor interface.

You can install HDF5 Python module: pip install h5py Keras gives you the ability to describe and save any model using the JSON format. In [ ]: from keras.models import model_from_json # serialize model to JSON model_json = model . to_json () with open ( \"model.json\" , \"w\" ) as json_file : json_file . write ( model_json ) # save weights to HDF5 model . save_weights ( \"model.h5\" ) print ( \"Model saved\" ) # when you want to retrieve the model: load json and create model json_file = open ( 'model.json' , 'r' ) saved_model = json_file . read () # close the file as good practice json_file . close () model_from_json = model_from_json ( saved_model ) # load weights into new model model_from_json . load_weights ( \"model.h5\" ) print ( \"Model loaded\" ) Exercise 1: Perform a GridSearch for Learning rate and number of epochs combined We will try various small standard learning rates, and momentum values from 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.2. We want to include the number of epochs in an optimization as there is a dependency between the learning rate, the batch size, and the number of epochs.

Part 1: Parts of a Convolutional Neural Net There are three types of layers in a Convolutional Neural Network: Convolutional Layers Pooling Layers. Dropout Layers. Fully Connected Layers. a. Convolutional Layers. Convolutional layers are comprised of filters and feature maps . The filters are essentially the neurons of the layer. They have the weights and produce the input for the next layer. The feature map is the output of one filter applied to the previous layer. The fundamental difference between a densely connected layer and a convolution layer is that dense layers learn global patterns in their input feature space (for example, for an MNIST digit, patterns involving all pixels), whereas convolution layers learn local patterns: in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D windows of the inputs called receptive fields . This key characteristic gives convnets two interesting properties: The patterns they learn are translation invariant . After learning a certain pattern in the lower-right corner of a picture, a convnet can recognize it anywhere: for example, in the upper-left corner. A densely connected network would have to learn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This makes convnets data efficient when processing images (because the visual world is fundamentally translation invariant): they need fewer training samples to learn representations that have generalization power. They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns . A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolution layer will learn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows convnets to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts (because the visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical). Convolutions operate over 3D tensors, called feature maps, with two spatial axes (height and width) as well as a depth axis (also called the channels axis). For an RGB image, the dimension of the depth axis is 3, because the image has three color channels: red, green, and blue. For a black-and-white picture, like the MNIST digits, the depth is 1 (levels of gray). The convolution operation extracts patches from its input feature map and applies the same transformation to all of these patches, producing an output feature map. This output feature map is still a 3D tensor: it has a width and a height. Its depth can be arbitrary, because the output depth is a parameter of the layer, and the different channels in that depth axis no longer stand for specific colors as in RGB input; rather, they stand for filters. Filters encode specific aspects of the input data: at a high level, a single filter could encode the concept \"presence of a face in the input,\" for instance. In the MNIST example that we will see, the first convolution layer takes a feature map of size (28, 28, 1) and outputs a feature map of size (26, 26, 32): it computes 32 filters over its input. Each of these 32 output channels contains a 26×26 grid of values, which is a response map of the filter over the input, indicating the response of that filter pattern at different locations in the input. Convolutions are defined by two key parameters: Size of the patches extracted from the inputs. These are typically 3×3 or 5×5 The number of filters computed by the convolution. Padding : One of \"valid\", \"causal\" or \"same\" (case-insensitive). \"valid\" means \"no padding\". \"same\" results in padding the input such that the output has the same length as the original input. \"causal\" results in causal (dilated) convolutions, In keras see convolutional layers keras.layers.Conv2D (filters, kernel_size, strides=(1, 1), padding='valid', activation=None, use_bias=True, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', data_format='channels_last', bias_initializer='zeros') How are the values in feature maps calculated? Exercise 1: Compute the operations by hand (assuming zero padding and same arrays for all channels) to produce the first element of the 4x4 feature map. How did we get the 4x4 output size? Write this Conv layer in keras -- your answer here b. Pooling Layers. Pooling layers are also comprised of filters and feature maps. Let's say the pooling layer has a 2x2 receptive field and a stride of 2. This stride results in feature maps that are one half the size of the input feature maps. We can use a max() operation for each receptive field. In keras see pooling layers keras.layers.MaxPooling2D (pool_size=(2, 2), strides=None, padding='valid', data_format=None) c. Dropout Layers. Dropout consists in randomly setting a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. In keras see Dropout layers keras.layers.Dropout(rate, seed=None) rate: float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop. seed: A Python integer to use as random seed. References Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting d. Fully Connected Layers. A fully connected layer flattens the square feature map into a vector. Then we can use a sigmoid or softmax activation function to output probabilities of classes. In keras see FC layers keras.layers.Dense (units, activation=None, use_bias=True, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', bias_initializer='zeros') IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HYPERPARAMETERS! stride size of filter number of filters poolsize Part 2: Preprocessing the data Taking a look at how images are represented in a computer using a photo of a Picasso sculpture In [ ]: img = plt . imread ( 'data/picasso.png' ) img . shape In [ ]: img [ 1 ,:, 1 ] In [ ]: print ( type ( img [ 50 ][ 0 ][ 0 ])) In [ ]: # let's see the image imgplot = plt . imshow ( img ) Visualizing the channels In [ ]: R_img = img [:,:, 0 ] G_img = img [:,:, 1 ] B_img = img [:,:, 2 ] plt . subplot ( 221 ) plt . imshow ( R_img , cmap = plt . cm .

If you want to learn more: Image Processing with Python and Scipy Part 3: Putting the Parts together to make a small ConvNet Model Let's put all the parts together to make a convnet for classifying our good old MNIST digits. In [ ]: # Load data and preprocess ( train_images , train_labels ), ( test_images , test_labels ) = mnist . load_data () # load MNIST data train_images . shape In [ ]: train_images . max (), train_images . min () In [ ]: train_images = train_images . reshape (( 60000 , 28 , 28 , 1 )) # Reshape to get third dimension train_images = train_images . astype ( 'float32' ) / 255 # Normalize between 0 and 1 test_images = test_images . reshape (( 10000 , 28 , 28 , 1 )) # Reshape to get third dimension test_images = test_images . astype ( 'float32' ) / 255 # Normalize between 0 and 1 # Convert labels to categorical data train_labels = to_categorical ( train_labels ) test_labels = to_categorical ( test_labels ) In [ ]: mnist_cnn_model = models . Sequential () # Create sequential model # Add network layers mnist_cnn_model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 32 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' , input_shape = ( 28 , 28 , 1 ))) mnist_cnn_model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) mnist_cnn_model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 64 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) mnist_cnn_model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) mnist_cnn_model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 64 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) The next step is to feed the last output tensor (of shape (3, 3, 64)) into a densely connected classifier network like those you're already familiar with: a stack of Dense layers. These classifiers process vectors, which are 1D, whereas the current output is a 3D tensor. First we have to flatten the 3D outputs to 1D, and then add a few Dense layers on top. In [ ]: mnist_cnn_model . add ( layers . Flatten ()) mnist_cnn_model . add ( layers . Dense ( 64 , activation = 'relu' )) mnist_cnn_model . add ( layers . Dense ( 10 , activation = 'softmax' )) mnist_cnn_model . summary () In [ ]: # Compile model mnist_cnn_model . compile ( optimizer = 'rmsprop' , loss = 'categorical_crossentropy' , metrics = [ 'accuracy' ]) # Fit the model mnist_cnn_model . fit ( train_images , train_labels , epochs = 5 , batch_size = 64 ) # Evaluate the model on the test data: test_loss , test_acc = mnist_cnn_model . evaluate ( test_images , test_labels ) test_acc A densely connected network (MLP) running MNIST usually has a test accuracy of 97.8%, whereas our basic convnet has a test accuracy of 99.03%: we decreased the error rate by 68% (relative) with only 5 epochs. Not bad! But why does this simple convnet work so well, compared to a densely connected model? The answer is above on how convolutional layers work! Data Preprocessing : Meet the ImageDataGenerator class in keras (docs) The MNIST and other pre-loaded dataset are formatted in a way that is almost ready for feeding into the model. What about plain images? They should be formatted into appropriately preprocessed floating-point tensors before being fed into the network. The Dogs vs. Cats dataset that you'll use isn't packaged with Keras. It was made available by Kaggle as part of a computer-vision competition in late 2013, back when convnets weren't mainstream. The data has been downloaded for you from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data The pictures are medium-resolution color JPEGs. In [ ]: # TODO: set your base dir to your correct local location base_dir = 'data/cats_and_dogs_small' import os , shutil # Set up directory information train_dir = os . path . join ( base_dir , 'train' ) validation_dir = os . path . join ( base_dir , 'validation' ) test_dir = os . path . join ( base_dir , 'test' ) train_cats_dir = os . path . join ( train_dir , 'cats' ) train_dogs_dir = os . path . join ( train_dir , 'dogs' ) validation_cats_dir = os . path . join ( validation_dir , 'cats' ) validation_dogs_dir = os . path . join ( validation_dir , 'dogs' ) test_cats_dir = os . path . join ( test_dir , 'cats' ) test_dogs_dir = os . path . join ( test_dir , 'dogs' ) print ( 'total training cat images:' , len ( os . listdir ( train_cats_dir ))) print ( 'total training dog images:' , len ( os . listdir ( train_dogs_dir ))) print ( 'total validation cat images:' , len ( os . listdir ( validation_cats_dir ))) print ( 'total validation dog images:' , len ( os . listdir ( validation_dogs_dir ))) print ( 'total test cat images:' , len ( os . listdir ( test_cats_dir ))) print ( 'total test dog images:' , len ( os . listdir ( test_dogs_dir ))) So you do indeed have 2,000 training images, 1,000 validation images, and 1,000 test images. Each split contains the same number of samples from each class: this is a balanced binary-classification problem, which means classification accuracy will be an appropriate measure of success. Building the network In [ ]: from keras import layers from keras import models model = models . Sequential () model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 32 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' , input_shape = ( 150 , 150 , 3 ))) model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 64 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 128 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 128 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( layers . Flatten ()) model . add ( layers . Dense ( 512 , activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( layers . Dense ( 1 , activation = 'sigmoid' )) model . summary () For the compilation step, you'll go with the RMSprop optimizer. Because you ended the network with a single sigmoid unit, you'll use binary crossentropy as the loss. In [ ]: from keras import optimizers model . compile ( loss = 'binary_crossentropy' , optimizer = optimizers . RMSprop ( lr = 1e-4 ), metrics = [ 'acc' ]) The steps for getting it into the network are roughly as follows: Read the picture files. Decode the JPEG content to RGB grids of pixels. Convert these into floating-point tensors. Rescale the pixel values (between 0 and 255) to the [0, 1] interval (as you know, neural networks prefer to deal with small input values). It may seem a bit daunting, but fortunately Keras has utilities to take care of these steps automatically with the class ImageDataGenerator , which lets you quickly set up Python generators that can automatically turn image files on disk into batches of preprocessed tensors. This is what you'll use here. In [ ]: from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator ( rescale = 1. / 255 ) test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator ( rescale = 1. / 255 ) train_generator = train_datagen . flow_from_directory ( train_dir , target_size = ( 150 , 150 ), batch_size = 20 , class_mode = 'binary' ) validation_generator = test_datagen . flow_from_directory ( validation_dir , target_size = ( 150 , 150 ), batch_size = 20 , class_mode = 'binary' ) Let's look at the output of one of these generators: it yields batches of 150×150 RGB images (shape (20, 150, 150, 3)) and binary labels (shape (20,)). There are 20 samples in each batch (the batch size). Note that the generator yields these batches indefinitely: it loops endlessly over the images in the target folder. For this reason, you need to break the iteration loop at some point: In [ ]: for data_batch , labels_batch in train_generator : print ( 'data batch shape:' , data_batch . shape ) print ( 'labels batch shape:' , labels_batch . shape ) break Let's fit the model to the data using the generator. You do so using the .fit_generator method, the equivalent of .fit for data generators like this one. It expects as its first argument a Python generator that will yield batches of inputs and targets indefinitely, like this one does. Because the data is being generated endlessly, the Keras model needs to know how many samples to draw from the generator before declaring an epoch over. This is the role of the steps_per_epoch argument: after having drawn steps_per_epoch batches from the generator—that is, after having run for steps_per_epoch gradient descent steps - the fitting process will go to the next epoch. In this case, batches are 20 samples, so it will take 100 batches until you see your target of 2,000 samples. When using fit_generator, you can pass a validation_data argument, much as with the fit method. It's important to note that this argument is allowed to be a data generator, but it could also be a tuple of Numpy arrays. If you pass a generator as validation_data, then this generator is expected to yield batches of validation data endlessly; thus you should also specify the validation_steps argument, which tells the process how many batches to draw from the validation generator for evaluation In [ ]: history = model . fit_generator ( train_generator , steps_per_epoch = 100 , epochs = 5 , # TODO: should be 30 validation_data = validation_generator , validation_steps = 50 ) # It's good practice to always save your models after training. model . save ( 'cats_and_dogs_small_1.h5' ) Let's plot the accuracy of the model over the training and validation data during training: In [ ]: fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 6 )) ax . plot (( history . history [ 'acc' ]), 'r' , label = 'train' ) ax . plot (( history . history [ 'val_acc' ]), 'b' , label = 'val' ) ax . set_xlabel ( r 'Epoch' , fontsize = 20 ) ax . set_ylabel ( r 'Accuracy' , fontsize = 20 ) ax . legend () ax . tick_params ( labelsize = 20 ) Let's try data augmentation In [ ]: datagen = ImageDataGenerator ( rotation_range = 40 , width_shift_range = 0.2 , height_shift_range = 0.2 , shear_range = 0.2 , zoom_range = 0.2 , horizontal_flip = True , fill_mode = 'nearest' ) These are just a few of the options available (for more, see the Keras documentation). Let's quickly go over this code: rotation_range is a value in degrees (0–180), a range within which to randomly rotate pictures. width_shift and height_shift are ranges (as a fraction of total width or height) within which to randomly translate pictures vertically or horizontally. shear_range is for randomly applying shearing transformations. zoom_range is for randomly zooming inside pictures. horizontal_flip is for randomly flipping half the images horizontally—relevant when there are no assumptions of - horizontal asymmetry (for example, real-world pictures). fill_mode is the strategy used for filling in newly created pixels, which can appear after a rotation or a width/height shift. Let's look at the augmented images In [ ]: from keras.preprocessing import image fnames = [ os . path . join ( train_dogs_dir , fname ) for fname in os . listdir ( train_dogs_dir )] img_path = fnames [ 3 ] # Chooses one image to augment img = image . load_img ( img_path , target_size = ( 150 , 150 )) # Reads the image and resizes it x = image . img_to_array ( img ) # Converts it to a Numpy array with shape (150, 150, 3) x = x . reshape (( 1 ,) + x . shape ) # Reshapes it to (1, 150, 150, 3) i = 0 for batch in datagen . flow ( x , batch_size = 1 ): plt . figure ( i ) imgplot = plt . imshow ( image . array_to_img ( batch [ 0 ])) i += 1 if i % 4 == 0 : break plt . show () If you train a new network using this data-augmentation configuration, the network will never see the same input twice. But the inputs it sees are still heavily intercorrelated, because they come from a small number of original images—you can't produce new information, you can only remix existing information. As such, this may not be enough to completely get rid of overfitting. To further fight overfitting, you'll also add a Dropout layer to your model right before the densely connected classifier. In [ ]: model = models . Sequential () model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 32 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' , input_shape = ( 150 , 150 , 3 ))) model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 64 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 128 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( layers . Conv2D ( 128 , ( 3 , 3 ), activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( layers . MaxPooling2D (( 2 , 2 ))) model . add ( layers . Flatten ()) model . add ( layers . Dropout ( 0.5 )) model . add ( layers . Dense ( 512 , activation = 'relu' )) model . add ( layers . Dense ( 1 , activation = 'sigmoid' )) model . compile ( loss = 'binary_crossentropy' , optimizer = optimizers . RMSprop ( lr = 1e-4 ), metrics = [ 'acc' ]) In [ ]: # Let's train the network using data augmentation and dropout. train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator ( rescale = 1. / 255 , rotation_range = 40 , width_shift_range = 0.2 , height_shift_range = 0.2 , shear_range = 0.2 , zoom_range = 0.2 , horizontal_flip = True ,) test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator ( rescale = 1. / 255 ) # Note that the validation data shouldn't be augmented! train_generator = train_datagen . flow_from_directory ( train_dir , target_size = ( 150 , 150 ), batch_size = 32 , class_mode = 'binary' ) validation_generator = test_datagen . flow_from_directory ( validation_dir , target_size = ( 150 , 150 ), batch_size = 32 , class_mode = 'binary' ) history = model . fit_generator ( train_generator , steps_per_epoch = 100 , epochs = 5 , # TODO: should be 100 validation_data = validation_generator , validation_steps = 50 ) model . save ( 'cats_and_dogs_small_2.h5' ) And let's plot the results again. Thanks to data augmentation and dropout, you're no longer overfitting: the training curves are closely tracking the validation curves. You now reach an accuracy of 82%, a 15% relative improvement over the non-regularized model. (Note: these numbers are for 100 epochs..) In [ ]: fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 10 , 6 )) ax . plot (( history . history [ 'acc' ]), 'r' , label = 'train' ) ax . plot (( history . history [ 'val_acc' ]), 'b' , label = 'val' ) ax . set_xlabel ( r 'Epoch' , fontsize = 20 ) ax . set_ylabel ( r 'Accuracy' , fontsize = 20 ) ax . legend () ax . tick_params ( labelsize = 20 ) By using regularization techniques even further, and by tuning the network's parameters (such as the number of filters per convolution layer, or the number of layers in the network), you may be able to get an even better accuracy, likely up to 86% or 87%. But it would prove difficult to go any higher just by training your own convnet from scratch, because you have so little data to work with. As a next step to improve your accuracy on this problem, you'll have to use a pretrained model.

Along the way, we'll learn about the \"formula\" interface to statsmodels, which gives an intuitive way of specifying regression models, and we'll review the different approaches to fitting curves. Key Skills: Importing (base) R functions Importing R library functions Populating vectors R understands Populating dataframes R understands Populating formulas R understands Running models in R Getting results back to Python Getting model predictions in R Plotting in R Reading R's documentation In [ ]: import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt % matplotlib inline Linear/Polynomial Regression (Python, Review) Hopefully, you remember working with Statsmodels during 109a Reading data and (some) exploring in Pandas: In [ ]: diab = pd . read_csv ( \"data/diabetes.csv\" ) print ( \"\"\" # Variables are: # subject: subject ID number # age: age diagnosed with diabetes # acidity: a measure of acidity called base deficit # y: natural log of serum C-peptide concentration # # Original source is Sockett et al.

Previously, we worked from a vector of target values and a design matrix we built ourself (e.g. from PolynomialFeatures). Now, Statsmodels' formula interface can help build the target value and design matrix for you. In [ ]: #Using statsmodels import statsmodels.formula.api as sm model1 = sm . ols ( 'y ~ age' , data = diab ) fit1_lm = model1 . fit () Build a data frame to predict values on (sometimes this is just the test or validation set) Very useful for making pretty plots of the model predcitions -- predict for TONS of values, not just whatever's in the training set In [ ]: x_pred = np . linspace ( 0 , 16 , 100 ) predict_df = pd . DataFrame ( data = { \"age\" : x_pred }) predict_df . head () Use get_prediction( ).summary_frame() to get the model's prediction (and error bars!)

What are the light error bars? Exercise 1 Fit a 3rd degree polynomial model and plot the model+error bars Route1: Build a design df with a column for each of age , age**2 , age**3 Route2: Just edit the formula Answers : 1.

After this section we'll know everything we need to in order to work with R models. The rest of the lab is just applying these concepts to run particular models. This section therefore is your 'cheat sheet' for working in R. What we need to know: Importing (base) R functions Importing R Library functions Populating vectors R understands Populating DataFrames R understands Populating Formulas R understands Running models in R Getting results back to Python Getting model predictions in R Plotting in R Reading R's documentation Importing R functions In [ ]: # if you're on JupyterHub you may need to specify the path to R #import os #os.environ['R_HOME'] = \"/usr/share/anaconda3/lib/R\" import rpy2.robjects as robjects In [ ]: r_lm = robjects . r [ \"lm\" ] r_predict = robjects . r [ \"predict\" ] #r_plot = robjects.r[\"plot\"] # more on plotting later #lm() and predict() are two of the most common functions we'll use Importing R libraries In [ ]: from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr #r_cluster = importr('cluster') #r_cluster.pam; Populating vectors R understands In [ ]: r_y = robjects . FloatVector ( diab [ 'y' ]) r_age = robjects . FloatVector ( diab [ 'age' ]) # What happens if we pass the wrong type? # How does r_age display? # How does r_age print? Populating Data Frames R understands In [ ]: diab_r = robjects . DataFrame ({ \"y\" : r_y , \"age\" : r_age }) # How does diab_r display? # How does diab_r print? Populating formulas R understands In [ ]: simple_formula = robjects .

Plotting in R In [ ]: % load_ext rpy2.ipython The above turns on the %R \"magic\" R's plot() command responds differently based on what you hand to it; Different models get different plots! For any specific model search for plot.modelname. E.g. for a GAM model, search plot.gam for any details of plotting a GAM model The %R \"magic\" runs R code in 'notebook' mode, so figures display nicely Ahead of the plot( ) code we pass in the variables R needs to know about ( -i is for \"input\") In [ ]: % R -i diab_lm plot(diab_lm); Reading R's documentation The documentation for the lm() funciton is here , and a prettier version (same content) is here . When googling, perfer rdocumentation.org when possible. Sections: Usage : gives the function signature, including all optional arguments Arguments : What each function input controls Details : additional info on what the funciton does and how arguments interact. Often the right place to start reading Value : the structure of the object returned by the function Refferences : The relevant academic papers See Also : other functions of interest Exercise 2 Add confidence intervals calculated in R to the linear regression plot above. Use the interval= argument to r_predict() (documentation here ). You will have to work with a matrix returned by R. Fit a 5th degree polynomial to the diabetes data in R. Search the web for an easier method than writing out a formula with all 5 polynomial terms. Answers 1.

We'll use it as another example as we transition languages. Discussion What is lowess smoothing? Which 109a models is it related to? How explainable is lowess? What are the tunable parameters? In Python In [ ]: from statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess import lowess as lowess ss1 = lowess ( diab [ 'y' ], diab [ 'age' ], frac = 0.15 ) ss2 = lowess ( diab [ 'y' ], diab [ 'age' ], frac = 0.25 ) ss3 = lowess ( diab [ 'y' ], diab [ 'age' ], frac = 0.7 ) ss4 = lowess ( diab [ 'y' ], diab [ 'age' ], frac = 1 ) In [ ]: ss1 [: 10 ,:] # we get back simple a smoothed y value for each x value in the data Notice the clean code to plot different models.

What makes a model high variance or high bias? In R We need to: Import the loess function Send data over to R Call the function and get results In [ ]: r_loess = robjects . r [ 'loess.smooth' ] #extract R function r_y = robjects . FloatVector ( diab [ 'y' ]) r_age = robjects .

(Though the zip() method seen earlier is great when e.g. the label and the parameter differ) In [ ]: for cur_frac in [ 0.15 , 0.25 , 0.7 , 1 ]: cur_smooth = r_loess ( r_age , r_y , span = cur_frac ) ax = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Lowess Fit, Fraction = {} \" . format ( cur_frac )) ax . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) ax . plot ( cur_smooth [ 0 ], cur_smooth [ 1 ], color = \"blue\" ) plt . show () Discussion Mark wasn't kidding; the Python and R results differ for frac=.15. Thoughts? Why isn't the bottom plot a straight line? We're using 100% of the data in each window... Smoothing Splines From this point forward, we're working with R functions; these models aren't (well) supported in Python. For clarity: this is the fancy spline model that minimizes $MSE - \\lambda\\cdot\\text{wiggle penalty}$ $=$ $\\sum_{i=1}&#94;N \\left(y_i - f(x_i)\\right)&#94;2 - \\lambda \\int \\left(f''(x)\\right)&#94;2$, across all possible functions $f$. The winner will always be a continuous, cubic polynomial with a knot at each data point Discussion Any idea why the winner is cubic? How interpretable is this model? What are the tunable parameters? In [ ]: r_smooth_spline = robjects . r [ 'smooth.spline' ] #extract R function # run smoothing function spline1 = r_smooth_spline ( r_age , r_y , spar = 0 ) Exercise 4 We actually set the spar parameter, a scale-free value that translates to a $\\lambda$ through a complex expression. Inspect the 'spline1' result and extract the implied value of $\\lambda$ Working from the fitting/plotting loop examples above, produce a plot like the one below for spar = [0,.5,.9,2], including axes labels and title. 1.

See package docs .

How would you describe the effect of age at diagnosis on C_peptide concentration? What are the costs/benefits of the (fancy) spline model, relative to the linear regression we fit above? Natural & Basis Splines Here, we take a step backward on model complexity, but a step forward in coding complexity.

Rough family guidelines: Response is binary or \"N occurances out of M tries\", e.g. number of lab rats (out of 10) developing disease: chooose \"binomial\" Response is a count with no logical upper bound, e.g. number of ice creams sold: choose \"poisson\" Response is real, with normally-distributed noise, e.g. person's height: choose \"gaussian\" (the default) In [ ]: #There is a Python library in development for using GAMs (https://github.com/dswah/pyGAM) # but it is not yet as comprehensive as the R GAM library, which we will use here instead. # R also has the mgcv library, which implements some more advanced/flexible fitting methods r_gam_lib = importr ( 'gam' ) r_gam = r_gam_lib . gam r_kyph = robjects .

However, predict always reports the sum of the individual variable effects. If family is non-default this can be different from the actual prediction for that point.

What is the model telling us about the effects of age, starting vertebrae, and number of vertebae operated on If we fit a logistic regression instead, which variables might want quadratic terms. What is the cost and benefit of a logistic regression model versus a GAM? Critique the model: What is it assuming? Are the assumptions reasonable Are we using the right data? Does the model's story about the world make sense? Appendix GAMs and smoothing splines support hypothesis tets to compare models.

Along the way, we'll learn about the \"formula\" interface to statsmodels, which gives an intuitive way of specifying regression models, and we'll review the different approaches to fitting curves. Key Skills: Importing (base) R functions Importing R library functions Populating vectors R understands Populating dataframes R understands Populating formulas R understands Running models in R Getting results back to Python Getting model predictions in R Plotting in R Reading R's documentation In [ ]: import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt % matplotlib inline Linear/Polynomial Regression (Python, Review) Hopefully, you remember working with Statsmodels during 109a Reading data and (some) exploring in Pandas: In [ ]: diab = pd . read_csv ( \"data/diabetes.csv\" ) print ( \"\"\" # Variables are: # subject: subject ID number # age: age diagnosed with diabetes # acidity: a measure of acidity called base deficit # y: natural log of serum C-peptide concentration # # Original source is Sockett et al. (1987) # mentioned in Hastie and Tibshirani's book # \"Generalized Additive Models\". \"\"\" ) display ( diab . head ()) display ( diab . dtypes ) display ( diab . describe ()) Plotting with matplotlib: In [ ]: ax0 = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Diabetes data\" ) #plotting direclty from pandas! ax0 . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax0 . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ); Linear regression with statsmodels. Previously, we worked from a vector of target values and a design matrix we built ourself (e.g. from PolynomialFeatures). Now, Statsmodels' formula interface can help build the target value and design matrix for you. In [ ]: #Using statsmodels import statsmodels.formula.api as sm model1 = sm . ols ( 'y ~ age' , data = diab ) fit1_lm = model1 . fit () Build a data frame to predict values on (sometimes this is just the test or validation set) Very useful for making pretty plots of the model predcitions -- predict for TONS of values, not just whatever's in the training set In [ ]: x_pred = np . linspace ( 0 , 16 , 100 ) predict_df = pd . DataFrame ( data = { \"age\" : x_pred }) predict_df . head () Use get_prediction( ).summary_frame() to get the model's prediction (and error bars!) In [ ]: prediction_output = fit1_lm . get_prediction ( predict_df ) . summary_frame () prediction_output . head () Plot the model and error bars In [ ]: ax1 = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Diabetes data with least-squares linear fit\" ) ax1 . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax1 . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'mean' ], color = \"green\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'mean_ci_lower' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'mean_ci_upper' ], color = \"blue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ); ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'obs_ci_lower' ], color = \"skyblue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ) ax1 . plot ( predict_df . age , prediction_output [ 'obs_ci_upper' ], color = \"skyblue\" , linestyle = \"dashed\" ); Discussion What are the dark error bars? What are the light error bars? Exercise 1 Fit a 3rd degree polynomial model and plot the model+error bars Route1: Build a design df with a column for each of age , age**2 , age**3 Route2: Just edit the formula Answers : 1. In [ ]: # your code here 2. In [ ]: # your code here Linear/Polynomial Regression, but make it R This is the meat of the lab. After this section we'll know everything we need to in order to work with R models. The rest of the lab is just applying these concepts to run particular models. This section therefore is your 'cheat sheet' for working in R. What we need to know: Importing (base) R functions Importing R Library functions Populating vectors R understands Populating DataFrames R understands Populating Formulas R understands Running models in R Getting results back to Python Getting model predictions in R Plotting in R Reading R's documentation Importing R functions In [ ]: # if you're on JupyterHub you may need to specify the path to R #import os #os.environ['R_HOME'] = \"/usr/share/anaconda3/lib/R\" import rpy2.robjects as robjects In [ ]: r_lm = robjects . r [ \"lm\" ] r_predict = robjects . r [ \"predict\" ] #r_plot = robjects.r[\"plot\"] # more on plotting later #lm() and predict() are two of the most common functions we'll use Importing R libraries In [ ]: from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr #r_cluster = importr('cluster') #r_cluster.pam; Populating vectors R understands In [ ]: r_y = robjects . FloatVector ( diab [ 'y' ]) r_age = robjects . FloatVector ( diab [ 'age' ]) # What happens if we pass the wrong type? # How does r_age display? # How does r_age print? Populating Data Frames R understands In [ ]: diab_r = robjects . DataFrame ({ \"y\" : r_y , \"age\" : r_age }) # How does diab_r display? # How does diab_r print? Populating formulas R understands In [ ]: simple_formula = robjects . Formula ( \"y~age\" ) simple_formula . environment [ \"y\" ] = r_y #populate the formula's .environment, so it knows what 'y' and 'age' refer to simple_formula . environment [ \"age\" ] = r_age Running Models in R In [ ]: diab_lm = r_lm ( formula = simple_formula ) # the formula object is storing all the needed variables In [ ]: simple_formula = robjects . Formula ( \"y~age\" ) # reset the formula diab_lm = r_lm ( formula = simple_formula , data = diab_r ) #can also use a 'dumb' formula and pass a dataframe Getting results back to Python In [ ]: diab_lm #the result is already 'in' python, but it's a special object In [ ]: print ( diab_lm . names ) # view all names In [ ]: diab_lm [ 0 ] #grab the first element In [ ]: diab_lm . rx2 ( \"coefficients\" ) #use rx2 to get elements by name! In [ ]: np . array ( diab_lm . rx2 ( \"coefficients\" )) #r vectors can be converted to numpy (but rarely needed) Getting Predictions In [ ]: # make a df to predict on (might just be the validation or test dataframe) predict_df = robjects . DataFrame ({ \"age\" : robjects . FloatVector ( np . linspace ( 0 , 16 , 100 ))}) # call R's predict() function, passing the model and the data predictions = r_predict ( diab_lm , predict_df ) In [ ]: x_vals = predict_df . rx2 ( \"age\" ) In [ ]: ax = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Diabetes data\" ) ax . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ); ax . plot ( x_vals , predictions ); #plt still works with r vectors as input! Plotting in R In [ ]: % load_ext rpy2.ipython The above turns on the %R \"magic\" R's plot() command responds differently based on what you hand to it; Different models get different plots! For any specific model search for plot.modelname. E.g. for a GAM model, search plot.gam for any details of plotting a GAM model The %R \"magic\" runs R code in 'notebook' mode, so figures display nicely Ahead of the plot( ) code we pass in the variables R needs to know about ( -i is for \"input\") In [ ]: % R -i diab_lm plot(diab_lm); Reading R's documentation The documentation for the lm() funciton is here , and a prettier version (same content) is here . When googling, perfer rdocumentation.org when possible. Sections: Usage : gives the function signature, including all optional arguments Arguments : What each function input controls Details : additional info on what the funciton does and how arguments interact. Often the right place to start reading Value : the structure of the object returned by the function Refferences : The relevant academic papers See Also : other functions of interest Exercise 2 Add confidence intervals calculated in R to the linear regression plot above. Use the interval= argument to r_predict() (documentation here ). You will have to work with a matrix returned by R. Fit a 5th degree polynomial to the diabetes data in R. Search the web for an easier method than writing out a formula with all 5 polynomial terms. Answers 1. In [ ]: # your code here 2.

What makes a model high variance or high bias? In R We need to: Import the loess function Send data over to R Call the function and get results In [ ]: r_loess = robjects . r [ 'loess.smooth' ] #extract R function r_y = robjects . FloatVector ( diab [ 'y' ]) r_age = robjects . FloatVector ( diab [ 'age' ]) ss1_r = r_loess ( r_age , r_y , span = 0.15 , degree = 1 ) In [ ]: ss1_r #again, a smoothed y value for each x value in the data Exercise 3 Predict the output of ss1_r[0] ss1_r.rx2(\"y\") 1. your answer here 2. your answer here Varying span Next, some extremely clean code to fit and plot models with various parameter settings. (Though the zip() method seen earlier is great when e.g. the label and the parameter differ) In [ ]: for cur_frac in [ 0.15 , 0.25 , 0.7 , 1 ]: cur_smooth = r_loess ( r_age , r_y , span = cur_frac ) ax = diab . plot . scatter ( x = 'age' , y = 'y' , c = 'Red' , title = \"Lowess Fit, Fraction = {} \" . format ( cur_frac )) ax . set_xlabel ( \"Age at Diagnosis\" ) ax . set_ylabel ( \"Log C-Peptide Concentration\" ) ax . plot ( cur_smooth [ 0 ], cur_smooth [ 1 ], color = \"blue\" ) plt . show () Discussion Mark wasn't kidding; the Python and R results differ for frac=.15. Thoughts? Why isn't the bottom plot a straight line? We're using 100% of the data in each window... Smoothing Splines From this point forward, we're working with R functions; these models aren't (well) supported in Python. For clarity: this is the fancy spline model that minimizes $MSE - \\lambda\\cdot\\text{wiggle penalty}$ $=$ $\\sum_{i=1}&#94;N \\left(y_i - f(x_i)\\right)&#94;2 - \\lambda \\int \\left(f''(x)\\right)&#94;2$, across all possible functions $f$. The winner will always be a continuous, cubic polynomial with a knot at each data point Discussion Any idea why the winner is cubic? How interpretable is this model? What are the tunable parameters? In [ ]: r_smooth_spline = robjects . r [ 'smooth.spline' ] #extract R function # run smoothing function spline1 = r_smooth_spline ( r_age , r_y , spar = 0 ) Exercise 4 We actually set the spar parameter, a scale-free value that translates to a $\\lambda$ through a complex expression. Inspect the 'spline1' result and extract the implied value of $\\lambda$ Working from the fitting/plotting loop examples above, produce a plot like the one below for spar = [0,.5,.9,2], including axes labels and title. 1. In [ ]: # your answer here 2. In [ ]: # your answer here CV R's smooth_spline funciton has built-in CV to find a good lambda. See package docs .

How would you describe the effect of age at diagnosis on C_peptide concentration? What are the costs/benefits of the (fancy) spline model, relative to the linear regression we fit above? Natural & Basis Splines Here, we take a step backward on model complexity, but a step forward in coding complexity. We'll be working with R's formula interface again, so we will need to populate Formulas and DataFrames. Discussion In what way are Natural and Basis splines less complex than the splines we were just working with? What makes a spline 'natural'? What makes a spline 'basis'? What are the tuning parameters? In [ ]: #We will now work with a new dataset, called GAGurine. #The dataset description (from the R package MASS) is below: #Data were collected on the concentration of a chemical GAG # in the urine of 314 children aged from zero to seventeen years. # The aim of the study was to produce a chart to help a paediatrican # to assess if a child's GAG concentration is ‘normal'. #The variables are: # Age: age of child in years. # GAG: concentration of GAG (the units have been lost).

First, let's get our (multivariate!) data In [ ]: kyphosis = pd . read_csv ( \"data/kyphosis.csv\" ) print ( \"\"\" # kyphosis - wherther a particular deformation was present post-operation # age - patient's age in months # number - the number of vertebrae involved in the operation # start - the number of the topmost vertebrae operated on \"\"\" ) display ( kyphosis . head ()) display ( kyphosis . describe ( include = 'all' )) display ( kyphosis . dtypes ) In [ ]: #If there are errors about missing R packages, run the code below: #r_utils = importr('utils') #r_utils.install_packages('codetools') #r_utils.install_packages('gam') To fit a GAM, we Import the gam library Populate a formula including s( ) on variables we want to fit smooths for Call gam(formula, family= ) where family is a string naming a probability distribution, chosen based on how the response variable is thought to occur. Rough family guidelines: Response is binary or \"N occurances out of M tries\", e.g. number of lab rats (out of 10) developing disease: chooose \"binomial\" Response is a count with no logical upper bound, e.g. number of ice creams sold: choose \"poisson\" Response is real, with normally-distributed noise, e.g. person's height: choose \"gaussian\" (the default) In [ ]: #There is a Python library in development for using GAMs (https://github.com/dswah/pyGAM) # but it is not yet as comprehensive as the R GAM library, which we will use here instead. # R also has the mgcv library, which implements some more advanced/flexible fitting methods r_gam_lib = importr ( 'gam' ) r_gam = r_gam_lib . gam r_kyph = robjects .

Calling R's plot() on a gam model is the easiest way to view the fitted splines In [ ]: % R -i kyph1_gam plot(kyph1_gam, residuals=TRUE,se=TRUE, scale=20); Prediction works like normal (build a data frame to predict on, if you don't already have one, and call predict() ). However, predict always reports the sum of the individual variable effects. If family is non-default this can be different from the actual prediction for that point. For instance, we're doing a 'logistic regression' so the raw prediction is log odds, but we can get probability by using in predict(..., type=\"response\") In [ ]: kyph_new = robjects .

What is the model telling us about the effects of age, starting vertebrae, and number of vertebae operated on If we fit a logistic regression instead, which variables might want quadratic terms. What is the cost and benefit of a logistic regression model versus a GAM? Critique the model: What is it assuming? Are the assumptions reasonable Are we using the right data? Does the model's story about the world make sense? Appendix GAMs and smoothing splines support hypothesis tets to compare models.
