A sentence can be thought of as a sequence of words which have semantic connections across time. By semantic connection, we mean that the words that occur earlier in the sentence influence the sentence's structure and meaning in the latter part of the sentence. There are also semantic connections backwards in a sentence, in an ideal case (in which we use RNNs from both directions and combine their outputs). But for the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to restrict ourselves to only uni-directional RNNs."
